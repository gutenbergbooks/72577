<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>BAMBI</span> is a delicious book. For delicacy of perception
and essential truth I hardly know any story of animals
that can stand beside this life study of a forest deer.
Felix Salten is a poet. He feels nature deeply, and he
loves animals. I do not, as a rule, like the method which
places human words in the mouths of dumb creatures,
and it is the triumph of this book that, behind the conversation,
one feels the real sensations of the creatures
who speak. Clear and illuminating, and in places very
moving, it is a little masterpiece.</p>

<p>I read it in galley proof on the way from Paris to
Calais, before a channel crossing. As I finished each
sheet I handed it to my wife, who read, and handed it
to my nephew’s wife, who read, and handed it to my
nephew. For three hours the four of us read thus in
silent absorption. Those who know what it is to read
books in galley proof, and have experienced channel
crossings, will realize that few books will stand such a
test. BAMBI is one of them. I particularly recommend
it to sportsmen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>He</span> came into the world in the middle
of the thicket, in one of those little, hidden
forest glades which seem to be entirely open, but
are really screened in on all sides. There was very
little room in it, scarcely enough for him and his
mother.</p>

<p>He stood there, swaying unsteadily on his thin
legs and staring vaguely in front of him with
clouded eyes which saw nothing. He hung his
head, trembled a great deal, and was still completely
stunned.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful child,” cried the magpie.</p>

<p>She had flown past, attracted by the deep groans
the mother uttered in her labor. The magpie
perched on a neighboring branch. “What a beautiful
child,” she kept repeating. Receiving no
answer, she went on talkatively, “How amazing to
think that he should be able to get right up and
walk! How interesting! I’ve never seen the like
of it before in all my born days. Of course, I’m
still young, only a year out of the nest, you might
say. But I think it’s wonderful. A child like that,
hardly a minute in this world, and beginning to
walk already! I call that remarkable. Really, I
find that everything you deer do is remarkable.
Can he run, too?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied the mother softly. “But
you must pardon me if I don’t talk with you now.
I have so much to do, and I still feel a little faint.”</p>

<p>“Don’t put yourself out on my account,” said
the magpie. “I have very little time myself. But
you don’t see a sight like this every day. Think
what a care and bother such things mean to us.
The children can’t stir once they are out of the
egg but lie helpless in the nest and require an attention,
an attention, I repeat, of which you simply
can’t have any comprehension. What a labor
it is to feed them, what a trouble to watch them.
Just think for a moment what a strain it is to hunt
food for the children and to have to be eternally
on guard lest something happen to them. They
are helpless if you are not with them. Isn’t it the
truth? And how long it is before they can move,
how long it is before they get their feathers and
look like anything at all.”</p>

<p>“Pardon,” replied the mother, “I wasn’t listening.”</p>

<p>The magpie flew off. “A stupid soul,” she
thought to herself, “very nice, but stupid.”</p>

<p>The mother scarcely noticed that she was gone.
She continued zealously washing her newly-born.
She washed him with her tongue, fondling and
caressing his body in a sort of warm massage.</p>

<p>The slight thing staggered a little. Under the
strokes of her tongue, which softly touched him
here and there, he drew himself together and
stood still. His little red coat, that was still somewhat
tousled, bore fine white spots, and on his
vague baby face there was still a deep, sleepy
expression.</p>

<p>Round about grew hazel bushes, dogwoods,
black-thorns and young elders. Tall maples,
beeches and oaks wove a green roof over the
thicket and from the firm, dark-brown earth
sprang fern fronds, wood-vetch and sage. Underneath,
the leaves of the violets, which had already
bloomed, and of the strawberries, which were just
beginning, clung to the ground. Through the
thick foliage, the early sunlight filtered in a
golden web. The whole forest resounded with
myriad voices, was penetrated by them in a joyous
agitation. The wood-thrush rejoiced incessantly,
the doves cooed without stopping, the blackbirds
whistled, finches warbled, the tit-mice chirped.
Through the midst of these songs the jay flew,
uttering its quarrelsome cry, the magpie mocked
them, and the pheasants cackled loud and high.
At times the shrill exulting of a woodpecker rose
above all the other voices. The call of the falcon
shrilled, light and piercing, over the tree-tops, and
the hoarse crow chorus was heard continuously.</p>

<p>The little fawn understood not one of the many
songs and calls, not a word of the conversations.
He did not even listen to them. Nor did he heed
any of the odors which blew through the woods.
He only heard the soft licking against his coat
that washed him and warmed him and kissed him.
And he smelled nothing but his mother’s body
near him. She smelled good to him and, snuggling
closer to her, he hunted eagerly around and found
nourishment for his life.</p>

<p>While he suckled, the mother continued to
caress her little one. “Bambi,” she whispered.
Every little while she raised her head and, listening,
snuffed the wind. Then she kissed her fawn
again, reassured and happy.</p>

<p>“Bambi,” she repeated. “My little Bambi.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>In</span> early summer the trees stood still
under the blue sky, held their limbs outstretched
and received the direct rays of the sun. On the
shrubs and bushes in the undergrowth, the flowers
unfolded their red, white and yellow stars. On
some the seed pods had begun to appear again.
They perched innumerable on the fine tips of
the branches, tender and firm and resolute, and
seemed like small, clenched fists. Out of the earth
came whole troops of flowers, like motley stars,
so that the soil of the twilit forest floor shone with
a silent, ardent, colorful gladness. Everything
smelled of fresh leaves, of blossoms, of moist clods
and green wood. When morning broke, or when
the sun went down, the whole woods resounded
with a thousand voices, and from morning till
night, the bees hummed, the wasps droned, and
filled the fragrant stillness with their murmur.</p>

<p>These were the earliest days of Bambi’s life.
He walked behind his mother on a narrow track
that ran through the midst of the bushes. How
pleasant it was to walk there. The thick foliage
stroked his flanks softly and bent supplely aside.
The track appeared to be barred and obstructed
in a dozen places and yet they advanced with the
greatest ease. There were tracks like this everywhere,
running criss-cross through the whole
woods. His mother knew them all, and if Bambi
sometimes stopped before a bush as if it were an
impenetrable green wall, she always found where
the path went through, without hesitation or
searching.</p>

<p>Bambi questioned her. He loved to ask his
mother questions. It was the pleasantest thing for
him to ask a question and then to hear what answer
his mother would give. Bambi was never
surprised that question after question should come
into his mind continually and without effort. He
found it perfectly natural, and it delighted him
very much. It was very delightful, too, to wait
expectantly till the answer came. If it turned out
the way he wanted, he was satisfied. Sometimes
of course, he did not understand, but that was
pleasant also because he was kept busy picturing
what he had not understood, in his own way.
Sometimes he felt very sure that his mother was
not giving him a complete answer, was intentionally
not telling him all she knew. And, at first,
that was very pleasant, too. For then there would
remain in him such a lively curiosity, such suspicion,
mysteriously and joyously flashing through
him, such anticipation, that he would become
anxious and happy at the same time, and grow
silent.</p>

<p>Once he asked, “Whom does this trail belong
to, Mother?”</p>

<p>His mother answered, “To us.”</p>

<p>Bambi asked again, “To you and me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“To us two?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Only to us two?”</p>

<p>“No,” said his mother, “to us deer.”</p>

<p>“What are deer?” Bambi asked, and laughed.</p>

<p>His mother looked at him from head to foot and
laughed too. “You are a deer and I am a
deer. We’re both deer,” she said. “Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Bambi sprang into the air for joy. “Yes, I
understand,” he said. “I’m a little deer and you’re
a big deer, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>His mother nodded and said, “Now you see.”</p>

<p>But Bambi grew serious again. “Are there
other deer besides you and me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” his mother said. “Many of them.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?” cried Bambi.</p>

<p>“Here, everywhere.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see them.”</p>

<p>“You will soon,” she said.</p>

<p>“When?” Bambi stood still, wild with curiosity.</p>

<p>“Soon.” The mother walked on quietly. Bambi
followed her. He kept silent for he was wondering
what “soon” might mean. He came to the
conclusion that “soon” was certainly not “now.”
But he wasn’t sure at what time “soon” stopped
being “soon” and began to be a “long while.”
Suddenly he asked, “Who made this trail?”</p>

<p>“We,” his mother answered.</p>

<p>Bambi was astonished. “We? You and I?”</p>

<p>The mother said, “We, we ... we deer.”</p>

<p>Bambi asked, “Which deer?”</p>

<p>“All of us,” his mother said sharply.</p>

<p>They walked on. Bambi was in high spirits and
felt like leaping off the path, but he stayed close
to his mother. Something rustled in front of
them, close to the ground. The fern fronds and
wood-lettuce concealed something that advanced
in violent motion. A threadlike, little cry shrilled
out piteously; then all was still. Only the leaves
and the blades of grass shivered back into place.
A ferret had caught a mouse. He came slinking
by, slid sideways, and prepared to enjoy his meal.</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked Bambi excitedly.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” his mother soothed him.</p>

<p>“But,” Bambi trembled, “but I saw it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said his mother. “Don’t be frightened.
The ferret has killed a mouse.” But Bambi
was dreadfully frightened. A vast, unknown horror
clutched at his heart. It was long before he
could speak again. Then he asked, “Why did he
kill the mouse?”</p>

<p>“Because,” his mother hesitated. “Let us walk
faster,” she said as though something had just occurred
to her and as though she had forgotten the
question. She began to hurry. Bambi sprang
after her.</p>

<p>A long pause ensued. They walked on quietly
again. Finally Bambi asked anxiously, “Shall we
kill a mouse, too, sometime?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied his mother.</p>

<p>“Never?” asked Bambi.</p>

<p>“Never,” came the answer.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Bambi, relieved.</p>

<p>“Because we never kill anything,” said his
mother simply.</p>

<p>Bambi grew happy again.</p>

<p>Loud cries were coming from a young ash
tree which stood near their path. The mother
went along without noticing them, but Bambi
stopped inquisitively. Overhead two jays were
quarreling about a nest they had plundered.</p>

<p>“Get away, you murderer!” cried one.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, you fool,” the other answered,
“I’m not afraid of you.”</p>

<p>“Look for your own nests,” the first one shouted,
“or I’ll break your head for you.” He was beside
himself with rage. “What vulgarity!” he chattered,
“what vulgarity!”</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>The other jay had spied Bambi and fluttered
down a few branches to shout at him. “What are
you gawking at, you freak?” he screamed.</p>

<p>Bambi sprang away terrified. He reached his
mother and walked behind her again, frightened
and obedient, thinking she had not noticed his
absence.</p>

<p>After a pause he asked, “Mother, what is vulgarity?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said his mother.</p>

<p>Bambi thought a while; then he began again.
“Why were they both so angry with each other,
Mother?” he asked.</p>

<p>“They were fighting over food,” his mother
answered.</p>

<p>“Will we fight over food, too, sometime?”
Bambi asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said his mother.</p>

<p>Bambi asked, “Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because there is enough for all of us,” his
mother replied.</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to know something else.
“Mother,” he began.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Will we be angry with each other sometime?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No, child,” said his mother, “we don’t do such
things.”</p>

<p>They walked along again. Presently it grew
light ahead of them. It grew very bright. The
trail ended with the tangle of vines and bushes.
A few steps more and they would be in the bright
open space that spread out before them. Bambi
wanted to bound forward, but his mother had
stopped.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked impatiently, already delighted.</p>

<p>“It’s the meadow,” his mother answered.</p>

<p>“What is a meadow?” asked Bambi insistently.</p>

<p>His mother cut him short. “You’ll soon find
out for yourself,” she said. She had become very
serious and watchful. She stood motionless, holding
her head high and listening intently. She
sucked in deep breathfuls of air and looked very
severe.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she said at last, “we can go out.”</p>

<p>Bambi leaped forward, but his mother barred
the way.</p>

<p>“Wait till I call you,” she said. Bambi obeyed
at once and stood still. “That’s right,” said his
mother, to encourage him, “and now listen to
what I am saying to you.” Bambi heard how
seriously his mother spoke and felt terribly excited.</p>

<p>“Walking on the meadow is not so simple,” his
mother went on. “It’s a difficult and dangerous
business. Don’t ask me why. You’ll find that out
later on. Now do exactly as I tell you to. Will
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bambi promised.</p>

<p>“Good,” said his mother, “I’m going out alone
first. Stay here and wait. And don’t take your
eyes off me for a minute. If you see me run back
here, then turn round and run as fast as you can.
I’ll catch up with you soon.” She grew silent and
seemed to be thinking. Then she went on earnestly,
“Run anyway as fast as your legs will carry
you. Run even if something should happen ...
even if you should see me fall to the ground....
Don’t think of me, do you understand? No matter
what you see or hear, start running right away
and just as fast as you possibly can. Do you
promise me to do that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bambi softly. His mother spoke so
seriously.</p>

<p>She went on speaking. “Out there if I should
call you,” she said, “there must be no looking
around and no questions, but you must get behind
me instantly. Understand that. Run without
pausing or stopping to think. If I begin to run,
that means for you to run too, and no stopping
until we are back here again. You won’t forget,
will you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bambi in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going ahead,” said his mother, and
seemed to become calmer.</p>

<p>She walked out. Bambi, who never took his
eyes off her, saw how she moved forward with
slow, cautious steps. He stood there full of expectancy,
full of fear and curiosity. He saw how
his mother listened in all directions, saw her
shrink together, and shrank together himself,
ready to leap back into the thickets. Then his
mother grew calm again. She stretched herself.
Then she looked around satisfied and called,
“Come!”</p>

<p>Bambi bounded out. Joy seized him with such
tremendous force that he forgot his worries in a
flash. Through the thicket he could see only the
green tree-tops overhead. Once in a while he
caught a glimpse of the blue sky.</p>

<p>Now he saw the whole heaven stretching far
and wide and he rejoiced without knowing why.
In the forest he had seen only a stray sunbeam
now and then, or the tender, dappled light that
played through the branches. Suddenly he was
standing in the blinding hot sunlight whose boundless
power was beaming upon him. He stood in
the splendid warmth that made him shut his eyes
but which opened his heart.</p>

<p>Bambi was as though bewitched. He was completely
beside himself with pleasure. He was
simply wild. He leaped into the air three, four,
five times. He had to do it. He felt a terrible
desire to leap and jump. He stretched his young
limbs joyfully. His breath came deeply and easily.
He drank in the air. The sweet smell of the
meadow made him so wildly happy that he had to
leap into the air.</p>

<p>Bambi was a child. If he had been a human
child he would have shouted. But he was a young
deer, and deer cannot shout, at least not the way
human children do. So he rejoiced with his legs
and with his whole body as he flung himself into
the air. His mother stood by and was glad. She
saw that Bambi was wild. She watched how he
bounded into the air and fell again awkwardly,
in one spot. She saw how he stared around him,
dazed and bewildered, only to leap up over and
over again. She understood that Bambi knew
only the narrow deer tracks in the forest and how
his brief life was used to the limits of the thicket.
He did not move from one place because he did
not understand how to run freely around the open
meadow.</p>

<p>So she stretched out her forefeet and bent
laughingly towards Bambi for a moment. Then
she was off with one bound, racing around in a
circle so that the tall grass stems swished.</p>

<p>Bambi was frightened and stood motionless.
Was that a sign for him to run back to the
thicket? His mother had said to him, “Don’t
worry about me no matter what you see or hear.
Just run as fast as you can.” He was going to
turn around and run as she had commanded him
to, but his mother came galloping up suddenly.
She came up with a wonderful swishing sound
and stopped two steps from him. She bent towards
him, laughing as she had at first and cried,
“Catch me.” And in a flash she was gone.</p>

<p>Bambi was puzzled. What did she mean?
Then she came back again running so fast that it
made him giddy. She pushed his flank with her
nose and said quickly, “Try to catch me,” and
fled away.</p>

<p>Bambi started after her. He took a few steps.
Then his steps became short bounds. He felt as if
he were flying without any effort on his part.
There was a space under his hoofs, space under
his bounding feet, space and still more space.
Bambi was beside himself with joy.</p>

<p>The swishing grass sounded wonderful to his
ears. It was marvelously soft and as fine as silk
where it brushed against him. He ran round in
a circle. He turned and flew off in a new circle,
turned around again and kept running.</p>

<p>His mother was standing still, getting her
breath again. She kept following Bambi with her
eyes. He was wild.</p>

<p>Suddenly the race was over. He stopped and
came up to his mother, lifting his hoofs elegantly.
He looked joyfully at her. Then they strolled
contentedly side by side.</p>

<p>Since he had been in the open, Bambi had felt
the sky and the sun and the green meadow with
his whole body. He took one blinding, giddy
glance at the sun, and he felt its rays as they lay
warmly on his back.</p>

<p>Presently he began to enjoy the meadow with
his eyes also. Its wonders amazed him at every
step he took. You could not see the tiniest speck
of earth the way you could in the forest. Blade
after blade of grass covered every inch of the
ground. It tossed and waved luxuriantly. It bent
softly aside under every footstep, only to rise up
unharmed again. The broad green meadow was
starred with white daisies, with the thick, round
red and purple clover blossoms and bright, golden
dandelion heads.</p>

<p>“Look, look, Mother!” Bambi exclaimed.
“There’s a flower flying.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a flower,” said his mother, “that’s a
butterfly.”</p>

<p>Bambi stared at the butterfly, entranced. It
had darted lightly from a blade of grass and was
fluttering about in its giddy way. Then Bambi
saw that there were many butterflies flying in the
air above the meadow. They seemed to be in a
hurry and yet moved slowly, fluttering up and
down in a sort of game that delighted him. They
really did look like gay flying flowers that would
not stay on their stems but had unfastened themselves
in order to dance a little. They looked, too,
like flowers that come to rest at sundown but have
no fixed places and have to hunt for them, dropping
down and vanishing as if they really had
settled somewhere, yet always flying up again, a
little way at first, then higher and higher, and
always searching farther and farther because all
the good places have already been taken.</p>

<p>Bambi gazed at them all. He would have loved
to see one close by. He wanted to see one face to
face but he was not able to. They sailed in and
out continually. The air was aflutter with them.</p>

<p>When he looked down at the ground again he
was delighted with the thousands of living things
he saw stirring under his hoofs. They ran and
jumped in all directions. He would see a wild
swarm of them, and the next moment they had
disappeared in the grass again.</p>

<p>“Who are they, Mother?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Those are ants,” his mother answered.</p>

<p>“Look,” cried Bambi, “see that piece of grass
jumping. Look how high it can jump!”</p>

<p>“That’s not grass,” his mother explained, “that’s
a nice grasshopper.”</p>

<p>“Why does he jump that way?” asked Bambi.</p>

<p>“Because we’re walking here,” his mother answered,
“he’s afraid we’ll step on him.”</p>

<p>“O,” said Bambi, turning to the grasshopper
who was sitting on a daisy; “O,” he said again
politely, “you don’t have to be afraid; we won’t
hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid,” the grasshopper replied in a
quavering voice; “I was only frightened for a
moment when I was talking to my wife.”</p>

<p>“Excuse us for disturbing you,” said Bambi shyly.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” the grasshopper quavered. “Since
it’s you, it’s perfectly all right. But you never
know who’s coming and you have to be careful.”</p>

<p>“This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever
been on the meadow,” Bambi explained; “my
mother brought me....”</p>

<p>The grasshopper was sitting with his head lowered
as though he were going to butt. He put on
a serious face and murmured, “That doesn’t interest
me at all. I haven’t time to stand here
gossiping with you. I have to be looking for
my wife. Hopp!” And he gave a jump.</p>

<p>“Hopp!” said Bambi in surprise at the high
jump with which the grasshopper vanished.</p>

<p>Bambi ran to his mother. “Mother, I spoke to
him,” he cried.</p>

<p>“To whom?” his mother asked.</p>

<p>“To the grasshopper,” Bambi said, “I spoke to
him. He was very nice to me. And I like him
so much. He’s so wonderful and green and you
can see through his sides. They look like leaves,
but you can’t see through a leaf.”</p>

<p>“Those are his wings,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“O,” Bambi went on, “and his face is so serious
and wise. But he was very nice to me anyhow.
And how he can jump! ‘Hopp!’ he said,
and he jumped so high I couldn’t see him any
more.”</p>

<p>They walked on. The conversation with the
grasshopper had excited Bambi and tired him a
little, for it was the first time he had ever spoken
to a stranger. He felt hungry and pressed close
to his mother to be nursed.</p>

<p>Then he stood quietly and gazed dreamily into
space for a little while with a sort of joyous
ecstasy that came over him every time he was
nursed by his mother. He noticed a bright flower
moving in the tangled grasses. Bambi looked
more closely at it. No, it wasn’t a flower, but a
butterfly. Bambi crept closer.</p>

<p>The butterfly hung heavily to a grass stem and
fanned its wings slowly.</p>

<p>“Please sit still,” Bambi said.</p>

<p>“Why should I sit still? I’m a butterfly,” the
insect answered in astonishment.</p>

<p>“O, please sit still, just for a minute,” Bambi
pleaded, “I’ve wanted so much to see you close
to. Please.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the butterfly, “for your sake I
will, but not for long.”</p>

<p>Bambi stood in front of him. “How beautiful
you are!” he cried fascinated; “how wonderfully
beautiful, like a flower!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the butterfly, fanning his wings,
“did you say like a flower? In my circle it’s generally
supposed that we’re handsomer than flowers.”</p>

<p>Bambi was embarrassed. “O, yes,” he stammered,
“much handsomer, excuse me, I only
meant ...”</p>

<p>“Whatever you meant is all one to me,” the
butterfly replied. He arched his thin body affectedly
and played with his delicate feelers.</p>

<p>Bambi looked at him enchanted. “How elegant
you are!” he said. “How elegant and fine!
And how splendid and white your wings are!”</p>

<p>The butterfly spread his wings wide apart, then
raised them till they folded together like an upright
sail.</p>

<p>“O,” cried Bambi, “I know that you are handsomer
than the flowers. Besides, you can fly and
the flowers can’t because they grow on stems,
that’s why.”</p>

<p>The butterfly spread his wings. “It’s enough,”
he said, “that I can fly.” He soared so lightly
that Bambi could hardly see him or follow his
flight. His wings moved gently and gracefully.
Then he fluttered into the sunny air.</p>

<p>“I only sat still that long on your account,”
he said balancing in the air in front of Bambi.
“Now I’m going.”</p>

<p>That was how Bambi found the meadow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>In</span> the heart of the forest was a little
glade that belonged to Bambi’s mother. It lay
only a few steps from the narrow trail where the
deer went bounding through the woods. But no
one could ever have found it who did not know
the little passage leading to it through the thick
bushes.</p>

<p>The glade was very narrow, so narrow that
there was only room for Bambi and his mother,
and so low that when Bambi’s mother stood up
her head was hidden among the branches. Sprays
of hazel, furze, and dogwood, woven about each
other, intercepted the little bit of sunlight that
came through the tree-tops, so that it never
reached the ground. Bambi had come into the
world in this glade. It was his mother’s and his.</p>

<p>His mother was lying asleep on the ground.
Bambi had dozed a little, too. But suddenly he
had become wide awake. He got up and looked
around.</p>

<p>The shadows were so deep where he was that
it was almost dark. From the woods came soft
rustlings. Now and again the tit-mice chirped.
Now and again came the clear hammering of the
woodpecker or the joyless call of a crow. Everything
else was still, far and wide. But the air
was sizzling in the midday heat so that you could
hear it if you listened closely. And it was stiflingly
sweet.</p>

<p>Bambi looked down at his mother and said,
“Are you asleep?”</p>

<p>No, his mother was not asleep. She had awakened
the moment Bambi got up.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?” Bambi asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” his mother answered. “We’re going
to stay right where we are. Lie down, like a
good boy, and go to sleep.”</p>

<p>But Bambi had no desire to go to sleep. “Come
on,” he begged, “let’s go to the meadow.”</p>

<p>His mother lifted her head. “Go to the meadow,”
she said, “go to the meadow now?” Her
voice was so full of astonishment and terror that
Bambi became quite frightened.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go to the meadow?” he asked
timidly.</p>

<p>“No,” his mother answered, and it sounded
very final. “No, you can’t go now.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Bambi perceived that something mysterious
was involved. He grew still more frightened,
but at the same time he was terribly anxious
to know everything. “Why can’t we go to the
meadow?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out all about it later when you’re
bigger,” his mother replied.</p>

<p>“But,” Bambi insisted, “I’d rather know now.”</p>

<p>“Later,” his mother repeated, “you’re nothing
but a baby yet,” she went on tenderly, “and we
don’t talk about such things to children.” She
had grown quite serious. “Fancy going to the
meadow at this time of day. I don’t even like to
think of it. Why, it’s broad daylight.”</p>

<p>“But it was broad daylight when we went to
the meadow before,” Bambi objected.</p>

<p>“That’s different,” his mother explained, “it
was early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Can we only go there early in the morning?”
Bambi was very curious.</p>

<p>His mother was patient. “Only in the early
morning or late evening,” she said, “or at night.”</p>

<p>“And never in the daytime, never?”</p>

<p>His mother hesitated. “Well,” she said at last,
“sometimes a few of us do go there in the daytime.... But those are special occasions.... I
can’t just explain it to you, you are too young
yet.... Some of us do go there.... But we
are exposed to the greatest danger.”</p>

<p>“What kind of danger?” asked Bambi all attention.</p>

<p>But his mother did not want to go on with the conversation.
“We’re in danger, and that’s enough for
you, my son. You can’t understand such things yet.”</p>

<p>Bambi thought that he could understand everything
except why his mother did not want to tell
him the truth. But he kept silent.</p>

<p>“That’s what life means for us,” his mother
went on, “though we all love the daylight, especially
when we’re young, we have to lie quiet
all day long. We can only roam around from
evening till morning. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bambi.</p>

<p>“So, my son, we’ll have to stay where we are.
We’re safe here. Now lie down again and go to
sleep.”</p>

<p>But Bambi didn’t want to lie down. “Why
are we safe here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because all the bushes shield us,” his mother
answered, “and the twigs snap on the shrubs and
the dry twigs crackle and give us warning. And
last year’s dead leaves lie on the ground and
rustle to warn us, and the jays and magpies keep
watch so we can tell from a distance if anybody
is coming.”</p>

<p>“What are last year’s leaves?” Bambi asked.</p>

<p>“Come and sit beside me,” said his mother,
“and I will tell you.” Bambi sat down contentedly,
nestling close to his mother. And she told
him how the trees are not always green, how the
sunshine and the pleasant warmth disappear.
Then it grows cold, the frost turns the leaves yellow,
brown and red, and they fall slowly so that
the trees and bushes stretch their bare branches to
the sky and look perfectly naked. But the dry
leaves lie on the ground, and when a foot stirs
them they rustle. Then someone is coming. O,
how kind last year’s dead leaves are! They
do their duty so well and are so alert and
watchful. Even in mid-summer there are a lot
of them hidden beneath the undergrowth. And
they give warning in advance of every danger.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Bambi pressed close against his mother. It was
so cozy to sit there and listen while his mother
talked.</p>

<p>When she grew silent he began to think. He
thought it was very kind of the good old leaves
to keep watch, though they were all dead and
frozen and had suffered so much. He wondered
just what that danger could be that his mother
was always talking about. But too much thought
tired him. Round about him it was still. Only
the air sizzling in the heat was audible. Then he
fell asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>One</span> evening Bambi was roaming about
the meadow again with his mother. He thought
that he knew everything there was to see or hear
there. But in reality it appeared that he did not
know as much as he thought.</p>

<p>This time was just like the first. Bambi played
tag with his mother. He ran around in circles,
and the open space, the deep sky, the fresh air
intoxicated him so that he grew perfectly wild.
After a while he noticed that his mother was
standing still. He stopped short in the middle of
a leap so suddenly that his four legs spread far
apart. To get his balance he bounded high into
the air and then stood erect. His mother seemed
to be talking to someone he couldn’t make out
through the tall grasses. Bambi toddled up inquisitively.</p>

<p>Two long ears were moving in the tangled
grass stems close to his mother. They were grayish-brown
and prettily marked with black stripes.
Bambi stopped, but his mother said, “Come here.
This is our friend, the Hare. Come here like a
nice boy and let him see you.”</p>

<p>Bambi went over. There sat the Hare looking
like a very honest creature. At times his long
spoon-like ears stood bolt upright. At others they
fell back limply as though they had suddenly
grown weak. Bambi became somewhat critical as
he looked at the whiskers that stood out so stiff
and straight on both sides of the Hare’s mouth.
But he noticed that the Hare had a very mild
face and extremely good-natured features, and
that he cast timid glances at the world from
out of his big round eyes. The Hare really
did look friendly. Bambi’s passing doubts vanished
immediately. But oddly enough, he had
lost all the respect he originally felt for the
Hare.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus5.jpg" alt="" id="illus5">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>There sat the Hare looking like a very honest creature.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“Good evening, young man,” the Hare greeted
him, with studied politeness.</p>

<p>Bambi merely nodded good evening. He didn’t
understand why, but he simply nodded. He was
very friendly and civil, but a little condescending.
He could not help it himself. Perhaps he was
born that way.</p>

<p>“What a charming young prince,” said the
Hare to Bambi’s mother. He looked at Bambi
attentively, raising first one spoon-like ear, then
the other, and then both of them, and letting
them fall again, suddenly and limply, which
didn’t please Bambi. The motion of the Hare’s
ears seemed to say, “He isn’t worth bothering
with.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Hare continued to study Bambi
with his big round eyes. His nose and his mouth
with the handsome whiskers moved incessantly in
the same way a man who is trying not to sneeze
twitches his nose and lips. Bambi had to laugh.</p>

<p>The Hare laughed quickly, too, but his eyes
grew more thoughtful. “I congratulate you,” he
said to Bambi’s mother. “I sincerely congratulate
you on your son. Yes, indeed, he’ll make a
splendid prince in time. Anyone can see that.”</p>

<p>To Bambi’s boundless surprise he suddenly sat
straight on his hind legs. After he had spied all
around with his ears stiffened and his nose constantly
twitching, he sat down decently on all
fours again. “Now if you good people will excuse
me,” he said at last, “I have all kinds of
things to do to-night. If you’ll be so good as to
excuse me....” He turned away and hopped
off with his ears back so that they touched his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” Bambi called after him.</p>

<p>His mother smiled. “The good Hare,” she
said; “he is so suave and prudent. He doesn’t
have an easy time of it in this world.” There was
sympathy in her voice.</p>

<p>Bambi strolled about a little and left his mother
to her meal. He wanted to meet his friend again
and he wanted to make new acquaintances, besides.
For without being very clear himself what
it was he wanted, he felt a certain expectancy.
Suddenly, at a distance, he heard a soft rustling on
the meadow, and felt a quick, gentle step tapping
the ground. He peered ahead of him. Over on the
edge of the woods something was gliding through
the grasses. Was it alive? No, there were two
things. Bambi cast a quick glance at his mother
but she wasn’t paying attention to anything and
had her head deep in the grass. But the game was
going on on the other side of the meadow in a
shifting circle exactly as Bambi himself had
raced around before. Bambi was so excited that
he sprang back as if he wanted to run away.
Then his mother noticed him and raised her
head.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” she called.</p>

<p>But Bambi was speechless. He could not find
his tongue and only stammered, “Look over
there.”</p>

<p>His mother looked over. “I see,” she said,
“that’s my sister, and sure enough she has a baby
too, now. No, she has two of them.” His mother
spoke at first out of pure happiness, but she had
grown serious. “To think that Ena has two
babies,” she said, “two of them.”</p>

<p>Bambi stood gazing across the meadow. He
saw a creature that looked just like his mother.
He hadn’t even noticed her before. He saw that
the grasses were being shaken in a double circle,
but only a pair of reddish backs were visible like
thin red streaks.</p>

<p>“Come,” his mother said, “we’ll go over.
They’ll be company for you.”</p>

<p>Bambi would have run, but as his mother
walked slowly, peering to right and to left at
every step, he held himself back. Still, he was
bursting with excitement and very impatient.</p>

<p>“I thought we would meet Ena sometime,”
his mother went on to say. “Where can she have
been keeping herself? I thought I knew she had
one child, that wasn’t hard to guess. But two of
them!...”</p>

<p>At last the others saw them and came to meet
them. Bambi had to greet his aunt, but his mind
was entirely on the children.</p>

<p>His aunt was very friendly. “Well,” she said
to him, “this is Gobo and that is Faline. Now
you run along and play together.”</p>

<p>The children stood stock-still and stared at
each other, Gobo close beside Faline and Bambi
in front of him. None of them stirred. They
stood and gaped.</p>

<p>“Run along,” said Bambi’s mother, “you’ll
soon be friends.”</p>

<p>“What a lovely child,” Aunt Ena replied. “He
is really lovely. So strong, and he stands so well.”</p>

<p>“O well,” said his mother modestly, “we have
to be content. But to have two of them, Ena!...”</p>

<p>“O yes, that’s all very well,” Ena declared;
“you know, dear, I’ve had children before.”</p>

<p>“Bambi is my first,” his mother said.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” Ena comforted her, “perhaps it
will be different with you next time, too.”</p>

<p>The children were still standing and staring at
each other. No one said a word. Suddenly
Faline gave a leap and rushed away. It had become
too much for her.</p>

<p>In a moment Bambi darted after her. Gobo
followed him. They flew around in a semi-circle,
they turned tail and fell over each other. Then
they chased each other up and down. It was
glorious. When they stopped, all topsy-turvy and
somewhat breathless, they were already good
friends. They began to chatter.</p>

<p>Bambi told them how he talked to the nice
grasshopper and the butterfly.</p>

<p>“Did you ever talk to the gold bug?” asked
Faline.</p>

<p>No, Bambi had never talked to the gold bug.
He did not even know who he was.</p>

<p>“I’ve talked to him often,” Faline declared, a
little pertly.</p>

<p>“The jay insulted me,” said Bambi.</p>

<p>“Really,” said Gobo astonished, “did the jay
treat you like that?” Gobo was very easily astonished
and was extremely timid.</p>

<p>“Well,” he observed, “the hedgehog stuck me
in the nose.” But he only mentioned it in passing.</p>

<p>“Who is the hedgehog?” Bambi asked eagerly.
It seemed wonderful to him to be there with
friends, listening to so many exciting things.</p>

<p>“The hedgehog is a terrible creature,” cried
Faline, “full of long spines all over his body and
very wicked!”</p>

<p>“Do you really think he’s wicked?” asked
Gobo. “He never hurts anybody.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” answered Faline quickly. “Didn’t
he stick you?”</p>

<p>“O, that was only because I wanted to speak to
him,” Gobo replied, “and only a little anyhow.
It didn’t hurt me much.”</p>

<p>Bambi turned to Gobo. “Why didn’t he want
you to talk to him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t talk to anybody,” Faline interrupted,
“even if you just come where he is he
rolls himself up so he’s nothing but prickles all
over. Our mother says he’s one of those people
who don’t want to have anything to do with the
world.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s only afraid,” Gobo said.</p>

<p>But Faline knew better. “Mother says you
shouldn’t meddle with such people,” she said.</p>

<p>Presently Bambi began to ask Gobo softly, “Do
you know what ‘danger’ means?”</p>

<p>Then they both grew serious and all three
heads drew together. Gobo thought a while. He
made a special effort to remember for he saw
how curious Bambi was for the answer. “Danger,”
he whispered, “is something very bad.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bambi declared excitedly, “I know it’s
something very bad, but what?” All three trembled
with fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly Faline cried out loudly and joyfully,
“I know what danger is—it’s what you run away
from.” She sprang away. She couldn’t bear to
stay there any longer and be frightened. In an
instant, Bambi and Gobo had bounded after her.
They began to play again. They tumbled in the
rustling, silky green meadow grass, and in a
twinkling had forgotten all about the absorbing
question. After a while they stopped and stood
chattering together as before. They looked towards
their mothers. They were standing close
together, eating a little and carrying on a quiet
conversation.</p>

<p>Aunt Ena raised her head and called the children.
“Come, Gobo. Come, Faline. We have to
go now.”</p>

<p>And Bambi’s mother said to him, “Come, it’s
time to go.”</p>

<p>“Wait just a little longer,” Faline pleaded
eagerly, “just a little while.”</p>

<p>“Let’s stay a little longer, please,” Bambi
pleaded, “it’s so nice.” And Gobo repeated timidly,
“It’s so nice, just a little longer.” All three
spoke at once.</p>

<p>Ena looked at Bambi’s mother. “What did I tell
you,” she said, “they won’t want to separate now.”</p>

<p>Then something happened that was much more
exciting than everything else that happened to
Bambi that day. Out of the woods came the sound
of hoofs beating the earth. Branches snapped, the
boughs rustled, and before Bambi had time to
listen, something burst out of the thicket. Someone
came crashing and rustling with someone else
rushing after him. They tore by like the wind,
described a wide circle on the meadow and vanished
into the woods again, where they could be
heard galloping. Then they came bursting out
of the thicket again and suddenly stood still,
about twenty paces apart.</p>

<p>Bambi looked at them and did not stir. They
looked like his mother and Aunt Ena. But their
heads were crowned with gleaming antlers covered
with brown beads and bright white prongs.
Bambi was completely overcome. He looked
from one to the other. One was smaller and his
antlers narrower. But the other one was stately
and beautiful. He carried his head up and his
antlers rose high above it. They flashed from
dark to light, adorned with the splendor of many
black and brown prongs.</p>

<p>“O,” cried Faline in admiration. “O,” Gobo
repeated softly. But Bambi said nothing. He
was entranced and silent. Then they both moved
and, turning away from each other, walked
slowly back into the woods in opposite directions.
The stately stag passed close to the children and
Bambi’s mother and Aunt Ena. He passed by
in silent splendor, holding his noble head royally
high and honoring no one with so much as a
glance.</p>

<p>The children did not dare to breathe till he
had disappeared into the thicket. They turned to
look after the other one, but at that very moment
the green door of the forest closed on him.</p>

<p>Faline was the first to break the silence. “Who
were they?” she cried. But her pert little voice
trembled.</p>

<p>“Who were they?” Gobo repeated in a hardly
audible voice. Bambi kept silent.</p>

<p>Aunt Ena said solemnly, “Those were your
fathers.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was said, and they parted. Aunt
Ena led her children into the nearest thicket. It
was her trail. Bambi and his mother had to cross
the whole meadow to the oak in order to reach
their own path. He was silent for a long time
before he finally asked, “Didn’t they see us?”</p>

<p>His mother understood what he meant and replied,
“Of course, they saw all of us.”</p>

<p>Bambi was troubled. He felt shy about asking
questions, but it was too much for him. “Then
why ...” he began, and stopped.</p>

<p>His mother helped him along. “What is it you
want to know, son?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they stay with us?”</p>

<p>“They don’t ever stay with us,” his mother answered,
“only at times.”</p>

<p>Bambi continued, “But why didn’t they speak
to us?”</p>

<p>His mother said, “They don’t speak to us now;
only at times. We have to wait till they come to
us. And we have to wait for them to speak to
us. They do it whenever they like.”</p>

<p>With a troubled heart, Bambi asked, “Will my
father speak to me?”</p>

<p>“Of course he will,” his mother promised.
“When you’re grown up he’ll speak to you, and
you’ll have to stay with him sometimes.”</p>

<p>Bambi walked silently beside his mother, his
whole mind filled with his father’s appearance.
“How handsome he is!” he thought over and
over again. “How handsome he is!”</p>

<p>As though his mother could read his thoughts,
she said, “If you live, my son, if you are cunning
and don’t run into danger, you’ll be as strong and
handsome as your father is sometime, and you’ll
have antlers like his, too.”</p>

<p>Bambi breathed deeply. His heart swelled
with joy and expectancy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Time</span> passed, and Bambi had many adventures
and went through many experiences. Every
day brought something new. Sometimes he felt
quite giddy. He had so incredibly much to learn.</p>

<p>He could listen now, not merely hear, when
things happened so close that they struck the ear
of their own accord. No, there was really no art
in that. He could really listen intelligently now
to everything that stirred, no matter how softly.
He heard even the tiniest whisper that the wind
brought by. For instance, he knew that a pheasant
was running through the next bushes. He
recognized clearly the soft quick tread that was
always stopping. He knew by ear the sound the
field mice make when they run to and fro on their
little paths. And the patter of the moles when
they are in a good humor and chase one another
around the elder bushes so that there is just the
slightest rustling. He heard the shrill clear call
of the falcon, and he knew from its altered, angry
tones when a hawk or an eagle approached. The
falcon was angry because she was afraid her field
would be taken from her. He knew the beat of
the wood-doves’ wings, the beautiful, distant, soaring
cries of ducks, and many other things besides.</p>

<p>He knew how to snuff the air now, too. Soon
he would do it as well as his mother. He could
breathe in the air and at the same time analyze
it with his senses. “That’s clover and meadow
grass,” he would think when the wind blew off
the fields. “And Friend Hare is out there, too.
I can smell him plainly.”</p>

<p>Again he would notice through the smell of
leaves and earth, wild leek and wood mustard,
that the ferret was passing by. He could tell by
putting his nose to the ground and snuffing deeply
that the fox was afoot. Or he would know that
one of his family was somewhere nearby. It
might be Aunt Ena and the children.</p>

<p>By now he was good friends with the night and
no longer wanted to run about so much in broad
daylight. He was quite willing to lie all day long
in the shade of the leafy glade with his mother.
He would listen to the air sizzling in the heat
and then fall asleep.</p>

<p>From time to time, he would wake up, listen
and snuff the air to find out how things stood.
Everything was as it should be. Only the tit-mice
were chattering a little to each other, the midges
who were hardly ever still, hummed, while the
wood-doves never ceased declaiming their ecstatic
tenderness. What concern was it of his?
He would drop off to sleep again.</p>

<p>He liked the night very much now. Everything
was alive, everything was in motion. Of course,
he had to be cautious at night too, but still he
could be less careful. And he could go wherever
he wanted to. And everywhere he went he met
acquaintances. They too were always less nervous
than in the daytime.</p>

<p>At night the woods were solemn and still.
There were only a few voices. They sounded
loud in the stillness, and they had a different ring
from daytime voices, and left a deeper impression.</p>

<p>Bambi liked to see the owl. She had such a
wonderful flight, perfectly light and perfectly
noiseless. She made as little sound as a butterfly,
and yet she was so dreadfully big. She had such
striking features, too, so pronounced and so deeply
thoughtful. And such wonderful eyes! Bambi
admired her firm, quietly courageous glance. He
liked to listen when she talked to his mother or to
anybody else. He would stand a little to one side,
for he was somewhat afraid of the masterful
glance that he admired so much. He did not understand
most of the clever things she said, but
he knew they were clever, and they pleased him
and filled him with respect for the owl.</p>

<p>Then the owl would begin to hoot. “Hoaah!—Ha!—Ha!—Haa!—ah!”
she would cry. It
sounded different from the thrushes’ song, or the
yellow-birds’, different from the friendly notes of
the cuckoo, but Bambi loved the owl’s cry, for he
felt its mysterious earnestness, its unutterable
wisdom and strange melancholy.</p>

<p>Then there was the screech-owl, a charming
little fellow, lively and gay with no end to his
inquisitiveness. He was bent on attracting attention.
“Oi, yeek! Oi, yeek!” he would call in a terrible,
high-pitched, piercing voice. It sounded as
if he were on the point of death. But he was
really in a beaming good humor and was hilariously
happy whenever he frightened anybody.
“Oi, yeek!” he would cry so dreadfully loud that
the forests heard it for a mile around. But afterwards
he would laugh with a soft chuckle, though
you could only hear it if you stood close by.</p>

<p>Bambi discovered that the screech-owl was delighted
whenever he frightened anyone, or when
anybody thought that something dreadful had
happened to him. After that, whenever Bambi
met him, he never failed to rush up and ask,
“What has happened to you?” or to say with a
sigh, “O, how you frightened me just now!”
Then the owl would be delighted.</p>

<p>“O, yes,” he would say, laughing, “it sounds
pretty gruesome.” He would puff up his feathers
into a grayish-white ball and look extremely
handsome.</p>

<p>There were storms, too, once or twice, both in
the daytime and at night. The first was in the
daytime and Bambi felt himself grow terrified as
it became darker and darker in his glade. It
seemed to him as if night had covered the sky at
mid-day. When the raging storm broke through
the woods so that the trees began to groan aloud,
Bambi trembled with terror. And when the lightning
flashed and the thunder growled, Bambi was
numb with fear and thought the end of the world
had come. He ran behind his mother, who had
sprung up somewhat disturbed and was walking
back and forth in the thicket. He could not think
about nor understand anything. The rain fell in
raging torrents. Everyone had run to shelter.
The woods were empty. But there was no escaping
the rain. The pouring water penetrated even
the thickest parts of the bushes. Presently the
lightning stopped, and the fiery rays ceased to
flicker through the tree-tops. The thunder rolled
away. Bambi could hear it in the distance, and
soon it stopped altogether. The rain beat more
gently. It pattered evenly and steadily around
him for another hour. The forest stood breathing
deeply in the calm and let the water drain off.
No one was afraid to come out any more. That
feeling had passed. The rain had washed it
away.</p>

<p>Never before had Bambi and his mother
gone to the meadow as early as on that evening.
It was not even dusk yet. The sun was still high
in the sky, the air was extremely fresh, and smelt
sweeter than usual, and the woods rang with a
thousand voices, for everyone had crept out of his
shelter and was running excitedly, telling what
had just happened.</p>

<p>Before they went on to the meadow, they
passed the great oak that stood near the forest’s
edge, close to their trail. They always had to pass
that beautiful big tree when they went to the
meadow.</p>

<p>This time the squirrel was sitting on a branch
and greeted them. Bambi was good friends with
the squirrel. The first time he met him he took
him for a very small deer because of the squirrel’s
red coat and stared at him in surprise. But
Bambi had been very childish at that time and
had known nothing at all.</p>

<p>The squirrel pleased him greatly from the first.
He was so thoroughly civil, and talkative. And
Bambi loved to see how wonderfully he could
turn, and climb, and leap, and balance himself.
In the middle of a conversation the squirrel
would run up and down the smooth tree trunk as
though there was nothing to it. Or he would sit
upright on a swaying branch, balance himself
comfortably with his bushy tail, that stuck up so
gracefully behind him, display his white chest,
hold his little forepaws elegantly in front of him,
nod his head this way and that, laugh with his
jolly eyes, and, in a twinkling, say a lot of comical
and interesting things. Then he would come
down again, so swiftly and with such leaps, that
you expected him to tumble on his head.</p>

<p>He twitched his long tail violently and called
to them from overhead, “Good day! Good day!
It’s so nice of you to come over.” Bambi and his
mother stopped.</p>

<p>The squirrel ran down the smooth trunk.
“Well,” he chattered, “did you get through it all
right? Of course, I see that everything is first
rate. That’s the main thing.”</p>

<p>He ran up the trunk again like lightning and
said, “It’s too wet for me down there. Wait, I’m
going to look for a better place. I hope you don’t
mind. Thanks, I knew you wouldn’t. And we
can talk just as well from here.”</p>

<p>He ran back and forth along a straight limb.
“It was a bad business,” he said, “a monstrous
uproar! You wouldn’t believe how scared I was.
I hunched myself up as still as a mouse in the
corner and hardly dared move. That’s the worst
of it, having to sit there and not move. And all
the time you’re hoping nothing will happen. But
my tree is wonderful in such cases. There’s no
denying it, my tree is wonderful! I’ll say that for
it. I’m satisfied with it. As long as I’ve had it,
I’ve never wanted any other. But when it cuts
loose the way it did to-day you’re sure to get
frightened no matter where you are.”</p>

<p>The squirrel sat up, balancing himself with his
handsome upright tail. He displayed his white
chest and pressed both forepaws protestingly
against his heart. You believed without his adding
anything that he had been excited.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“We’re going to the meadow now to dry ourselves
off in the sun,” Bambi’s mother said.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” cried the squirrel, “you’re
really so clever. I’m always saying how clever
you are.” With a bound he sprang onto a higher
branch. “You couldn’t do anything better than
go to the meadow now,” he called down. Then
he swung with light bounds back and forth
through the tree-top. “I’m going up where I can
get the sunlight,” he chattered merrily, “I’m all
soaked through. I’m going all the way up.” He
didn’t care whether they were still listening to
him or not.</p>

<p>The meadow was full of life. Friend Hare was
there and had brought along his family. Aunt
Ena was there with her children and a few acquaintances.
That day Bambi saw the fathers
again. They came slowly out of the forest from
opposite directions. There was a third stag too.
Each walked slowly in his track, back and forth,
along the meadow. They paid no attention to
anyone and did not even talk to one another.
Bambi looked at them frequently. He was respectful,
but full of curiosity.</p>

<p>Then he talked to Faline and Gobo and a few
other children. He wanted to play a while. All
agreed and they began running around in a circle.
Faline was the gayest of all. She was so fresh
and nimble and brimming over with bright ideas.
But Gobo was soon tired. He had been terribly
frightened by the storm. His heart had hammered
loudly and was still pounding. There
was something very weak about Gobo, but
Bambi liked him because he was so good and willing
and always a little sad without letting you
know it.</p>

<p>Time passed and Bambi was learning how
good the meadow grass tasted, how tender and
sweet the leaf buds and the clover were. When
he nestled against his mother for comfort it often
happened that she pushed him away.</p>

<p>“You aren’t a little baby any more,” she would
say. Sometimes she even said abruptly, “Go away
and let me be.” It even happened sometimes that
his mother got up in the little forest glade, got up
in the middle of the day, and went off without
noticing whether Bambi was following her or
not. At times it seemed, when they were wandering
down the familiar paths, as if his mother did
not want to notice whether Bambi was behind her
or was trailing after.</p>

<p>One day his mother was gone. Bambi did not
know how such a thing could be possible, he
could not figure it out. But his mother was gone
and for the first time Bambi was left alone.</p>

<p>He wandered about, he was troubled, he grew
worried and anxious and began to want her terribly.
He stood quite sadly, calling her. Nobody
answered and nobody came.</p>

<p>He listened and snuffed the air. He could not
smell anything. He called again. Softly, pathetically,
tearfully, he called “Mother, Mother!”
In vain.</p>

<p>Then despair seized him, he could not stand it
and started to walk.</p>

<p>He wandered down the trails he knew, stopping
and calling. He wandered farther and farther
with hesitating steps, frightened and helpless.
He was very downcast.</p>

<p>He went on and on and came to trails where
he had never been before. He came to places that
were strange to him. He no longer knew where
he was going.</p>

<p>Then he heard two childish voices like his own,
calling, “Mother! Mother!” He stood still and
listened. Surely that was Gobo and Faline. It
must be they.</p>

<p>He ran quickly towards the voices and soon he
saw their little red jackets showing through the
leaves. Gobo and Faline were standing side by
side under a dog-wood tree and calling mournfully,
“Mother, Mother!”</p>

<p>They were overjoyed when they heard the rustling
in the bushes. But they were disappointed
when they saw Bambi. They were a little consoled
that he was there, however. And Bambi
was glad not to be all alone any more.</p>

<p>“My mother is gone,” Bambi said.</p>

<p>“Ours is gone too,” Gobo answered plaintively.</p>

<p>They looked at one another and were quite despondent.</p>

<p>“Where can they be?” asked Bambi. He was
almost sobbing.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” sighed Gobo. His heart was
pounding and he felt miserable.</p>

<p>Suddenly Faline said, “I think they may be
with our fathers.”</p>

<p>Gobo and Bambi looked at her surprised. They
were filled with awe. “You mean that they’re visiting
our fathers?” asked Bambi and trembled.
Faline trembled too, but she made a wise face.
She acted like a person who knows more than she
will let on. Of course she knew nothing, she
could not even guess where her idea came from.
But when Gobo repeated, “Do you really think
so?” she put on a meaningful air and answered
mysteriously, “Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>Anyway it was a suggestion that needed to be
thought about. But in spite of that Bambi felt
no easier. He couldn’t even think about it, he
was too troubled and too sad.</p>

<p>He went off. He wouldn’t stay in one place.
Faline and Gobo went along with him for a little
way. All three were calling, “Mother, Mother!”
Then Gobo and Faline stopped, they did not dare
go any farther. Faline said, “Why should we?
Mother knows where we are. Let’s stay here so
she can find us when she comes back.”</p>

<p>Bambi went on alone. He wandered through a
thicket to a little clearing. In the middle of the
clearing Bambi stopped short. He suddenly felt
as if he were rooted to the ground and could not
move.</p>

<p>On the edge of the clearing, by a tall hazel
bush, a creature was standing. Bambi had never
seen such a creature before. At the same time
the air brought him a scent such as he had never
smelled in his life. It was a strange smell, heavy
and acrid. It excited him to the point of madness.</p>

<p>Bambi stared at the creature. It stood remarkably
erect. It was extremely thin and had a pale
face; entirely bare around the nose and the eyes.
A kind of dread emanated from that face, a cold
terror. That face had a tremendous power over
him. It was unbearably painful to look at that
face and yet Bambi stood staring fixedly at it.</p>

<p>For a long time the creature stood without
moving. Then it stretched out a leg from high
up near its face. Bambi had not even noticed that
there was one there. But as that terrible leg was
reaching out into the air Bambi was swept away
by the mere gesture. In a flash he was back into
the thicket he came from, and was running away.</p>

<p>In a twinkling his mother was with him again,
too. She bounded beside him over shrubs and
bushes. They ran side by side as fast as they
could. His mother was in the lead. She knew
the way and Bambi followed. They ran till they
came to their glade.</p>

<p>“Did you see Him?” asked the mother softly.</p>

<p>Bambi could not answer, he had no breath left.
He only nodded.</p>

<p>“That was He,” said the mother.</p>

<p>And they both shuddered.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Bambi</span> was often alone now. But
he was not so troubled about it as he had been the
first time. His mother would disappear, and no
matter how much he called her she wouldn’t
come back. Later she would appear unexpectedly
and stay with him as before.</p>

<p>One night he was roaming around quite forlorn
again. He could not even find Gobo and Faline.
The sky had become pale gray and it began to
darken so that the tree-tops seemed like a vault
over the bushy undergrowth. There was a swishing
in the bushes, a loud rustling came through
the leaves and Bambi’s mother dashed out. Someone
else raced close behind her. Bambi did
not know whether it was Aunt Ena or his father
or someone else. But he recognized his mother
at once. Though she rushed past him so quickly,
he had recognized her voice. She screamed,
and it seemed to Bambi as if it were in play,
though he thought it sounded a little frightened
too.</p>

<p>One day Bambi wandered for hours through
the thicket. At last he began to call. He simply
couldn’t bear to be so utterly lonely any more.
He felt that pretty soon he’d be perfectly miserable.
So he began to call for his mother.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the fathers was standing in
front of him looking sternly down at him. Bambi
hadn’t heard him coming and was terrified. This
stag looked more powerful than the others, taller
and prouder. His coat shone with a deeper richer
red, but his face shimmered, silvery gray. And
tall, black, beaded antlers rose high above his
nervous ears.</p>

<p>“What are you crying about?” the old stag
asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe and did
not dare answer. “Your mother has no time for
you now,” the old stag went on. Bambi was completely
dominated by his masterful voice and at
the same time, he admired it. “Can’t you stay
by yourself? Shame on you!”</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to say that he was perfectly
able to stay by himself, that he had often been
left alone already, but he could not get it out.
He was obedient and he felt terribly ashamed.
The stag turned around and was gone. Bambi
didn’t know where or how, or whether the stag
had gone slow or fast. He had simply gone
as suddenly as he had come. Bambi strained
his ears to listen but he could not catch the
sound of a departing footstep or a leaf stirring.
So he thought the old stag must be somewhere
close by and snuffed the air in all directions.
It brought him no scent. Bambi sighed with
relief to think he was alone. But he felt a lively
desire to see the old stag again and win his
approval.</p>

<p>When his mother came back he did not tell her
anything of his encounter. He did not call her
any more either the next time she disappeared.
He thought of the old stag while he wandered
around. He wanted very much to meet him. He
wanted to say to him, “See, I don’t call my mother
any more,” so the old stag would praise him.</p>

<p>But he told Gobo and Faline the next time they
were together on the meadow. They listened attentively
and had nothing to relate that could
compare with this.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you frightened?” asked Gobo excitedly.</p>

<p>O well—Bambi confessed he had been frightened.
But only a little.</p>

<p>“I should have been terribly frightened,” Gobo
declared.</p>

<p>Bambi replied, no, he hadn’t been very much
afraid, because the stag was so handsome.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t have helped me much,” Gobo
added, “I’d have been too afraid to look at him.
When I’m frightened I have streaks before my
eyes so that I can’t see at all, and my heart beats
so fast that I can’t breathe.”</p>

<p>Faline became very thoughtful after Bambi’s
story and did not say anything.</p>

<p>But the next time they met, Gobo and Faline
bounded up in great haste. They were alone
again and so was Bambi. “We have been hunting
for you all this time,” cried Gobo. “Yes,” Faline
said importantly, “because now we know who it
was you saw.” Bambi bounded into the air for
curiosity and asked, “Who?”</p>

<p>Faline said solemnly, “It was the old Prince.”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” Bambi demanded.</p>

<p>“Mother,” Faline replied.</p>

<p>Bambi was amazed. “Did you tell her the
whole story?” They both nodded. “But it was a
secret,” Bambi cried angrily.</p>

<p>Gobo tried to shield himself at once. “I didn’t
do it, it was Faline,” he said. But Faline cried
excitedly, “What do you mean, a secret? I wanted
to know who it was. Now we all know and it’s
much more exciting.”</p>

<p>Bambi was burning up with desire to hear all
about it and let himself be mollified. Faline told
him everything. “The old Prince is the biggest
stag in the whole forest. There isn’t anybody else
that compares with him. Nobody knows how old
he is. Nobody can find out where he lives. No
one knows his family. Very few have seen him
even once. At times he was thought to be dead
because he hadn’t been seen for so long. Then
someone would see him again for a second and so
they knew he was still alive. Nobody had ever
dared ask him where he had been. He speaks to
nobody and no one dares speak to him. He uses
trails none of the others ever use. He knows the
very depths of the forest. And he does not know
such a thing as danger. Other Princes fight one
another at times, sometimes in fun or to try each
other out, sometimes in earnest. For many years
no one has fought with the old stag. And of those
who fought with him long ago not one is living.
He is the great Prince.”</p>

<p>Bambi forgave Gobo and Faline for babbling
his secret to their mother. He was even glad to
have found out all these important things, but he
was glad that Gobo and Faline did not know all
about it. They did not know that the great Prince
had said, “Can’t you stay by yourself? Shame on
you!” Now Bambi was very glad that he had not
told them about these things. For then Gobo and
Faline would have told that along with the rest,
and the whole forest would have gossiped
about it.</p>

<p>That night when the moon rose Bambi’s mother
came back again. He suddenly saw her standing
under the great oak at the edge of the meadow
looking around for him. He saw her right away
and ran to her.</p>

<p>That night Bambi learned something new. His
mother was tired and hungry. They did not walk
as far as usual. The mother quieted her hunger
on the meadow where Bambi too was used to eating
most of his meals. Side by side they nibbled
at the bushes and pleasantly ruminating, went
farther and farther into the woods.</p>

<p>Presently there was a loud rustling in the
bushes. Before Bambi could guess what it was
his mother began to cry aloud as she did when
she was very terrified or when she was beside herself.
“Aoh!” she cried and, giving a bound,
stopped and cried, “Aoh, baoh!” Bambi tried to
make out the mighty forms which were drawing
near as the rustling grew louder. They were
right near now. They resembled Bambi and
Bambi’s mother, Aunt Ena and all the rest of his
family, but they were gigantic and so powerfully
built that he stared up at them overcome.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bambi began to bleat, “Aoh baohbaoh!”
He hardly knew he was bleating. He
couldn’t help himself. The procession tramped
slowly by. Three, four giant apparitions, one after
the other. The last of them was bigger than any
of the others. He had a wild mane on his neck
and his antlers were tree-like. It took Bambi’s
breath away to see them. He stood and bleated
from a heart full of wonder, for he was more
weirdly affected than ever before in his life. He
was afraid, but in a peculiar way. He felt how
pitifully small he was, and even his mother
seemed to him to have shrunk. He felt ashamed
without understanding why, and at the same time
terror shook him. He bleated, “Baoh! b-a-o-h!”
He felt better when he bleated that way.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>The procession had gone by. There was nothing
more to be seen or heard. Even his mother was
silent. Only Bambi kept giving short bleats now
and then. He still felt the shock.</p>

<p>“Be still,” his mother said, “they have gone now.”</p>

<p>“O, Mother,” Bambi whispered, “who was it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said his mother, “they are not so dangerous
when all is said and done. Those are your
big cousins, the elk—they are strong and they
are important, far stronger than we are.”</p>

<p>“And aren’t they dangerous?” Bambi asked.</p>

<p>“Not as a rule,” his mother explained. “Of
course, a good many things are said to have happened.
This and that is told about them, but I
don’t know if there is any truth in such gossip or
not. They’ve never done any harm to me or to
any one of my acquaintances.”</p>

<p>“Why should they do anything to us?” asked
Bambi, “if they are cousins of ours?” He wanted
to feel calm but he kept trembling.</p>

<p>“O, they never do anything to us,” his mother
answered, “but I don’t know why, I’m frightened
whenever I see them. I don’t understand it myself.
But it happens that way every time.”</p>

<p>Bambi was gradually reassured by her words
but he remained thoughtful. Right above him in
the branches of an alder, the screech-owl was hooting
in his blood-curdling way. Bambi was distracted
and forgot to act as if he had been
frightened. But the screech-owl flew by anyhow
and asked, “Didn’t I frighten you?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Bambi replied, “you always
frighten me.”</p>

<p>The screech-owl chuckled softly. He was
pleased. “I hope you don’t hold it against me,” he
said, “it’s just my way.” He fluffed himself up
so that he resembled a ball, sank his bill in his
foamy white feathers and put on a terribly wise
and serious face. He was satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>Bambi poured out his heart to him. “Do you
know?” he began slyly, “I’ve just had a much
worse fright.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the owl displeased. Bambi told
him about his encounter with his giant relations.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about relations,” the owl exclaimed,
“I’ve got relations too. But I only fly
around in the daytime so they are all down on
me now. No, there isn’t much use in relations. If
they’re bigger than you are, they’re no good to
you, and if they’re smaller they’re worth still less.
If they’re bigger than you, you can’t bear them
because they’re proud, and if they’re smaller they
can’t bear you because you’re proud. No, I prefer
to have nothing to do with the whole crowd.”</p>

<p>“But, I don’t even know my relations,” Bambi
said, laughing shyly, “I never heard of them, I
never saw them before to-day.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about such people,” the screech-owl
advised. “Believe me,” and he rolled his eyes
significantly, “believe me, it’s the best way. Relatives
are never as good as friends. Look at us,
we’re not related in any way but we’re good
friends and that’s much better.”</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to say something else but the
screech-owl went on, “I’ve had experience with
such things. You are still too young but, believe
me, I know better. Besides, I don’t like to get
mixed up in family affairs.” He rolled his eyes
thoughtfully and looked so impressive with his
serious face that Bambi kept a discreet silence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Another</span> night passed and morning
brought an event.</p>

<p>It was a cloudless morning, dewy and fresh. All
the leaves on the trees and the bushes seemed suddenly
to smell sweeter. The meadows sent up
great clouds of perfume to the tree-tops.</p>

<p>“Peep!” said the tit-mice when they awoke.
They said it very softly. But since it was still gray
dawn they said nothing else for a while. For a
time it was perfectly still. Then a crow’s hoarse,
rasping caw sounded far above in the sky. The
crows had awakened and were visiting one another
in the tree-tops. The magpie answered at once,
“Shackarakshak! Did you think I was still
asleep?” Then a hundred small voices started in
very softly here and there. “Peep! peep! tiu!”
Sleep and the dark were still in these sounds. And
they came from far apart.</p>

<p>Suddenly a blackbird flew to the top of a beech.
She perched way up on the topmost twig that
stuck up thin against the sky and sat there watching
how, far away over the trees, the night-weary,
pale-gray heavens were glowing in the distant east
and coming to life. Then she commenced to sing.</p>

<p>Her little black body seemed only a tiny dark
speck at that distance. She looked like a dead
leaf. But she poured out her song in a great flood
of rejoicing through the whole forest. And everything
began to stir. The finches warbled, the little
red-throat and the gold finch were heard. The
doves rushed from place to place with a loud
clapping and rustling of wings. The pheasants
cackled as though their throats would burst. The
noise of their wings, as they flew from their roosts
to the ground, was soft but powerful. They kept
uttering their metallic, splintering call with its
soft ensuing chuckle. Far above the falcons cried
sharply and joyously, “Yayaya!”</p>

<p>The sun rose.</p>

<p>“Diu diyu!” the yellow-bird rejoiced. He flew
to and fro among the branches, and his round,
yellow body flashed in the morning light like a
winged ball of gold.</p>

<p>Bambi walked under the great oak on the
meadow. It sparkled with dew. It smelled of
grass and flowers and moist earth, and whispered
of a thousand living things. Friend Hare was
there and seemed to be thinking over something
important. A haughty pheasant strutted slowly
by, nibbling at the grass seeds and peering cautiously
in all directions. The dark, metallic blue
on his neck gleamed in the sun.</p>

<p>One of the Princes was standing close to Bambi.
Bambi had never seen any of the fathers so close
before. The stag was standing right in front of
him next to the hazel bush and was somewhat
hidden by the branches. Bambi did not move.
He wanted the Prince to come out completely,
and was wondering whether he dared speak to
him. He wanted to ask his mother and looked
around for her. But his mother had already gone
away and was standing some distance off, beside
Aunt Ena. At the same time Gobo and Faline
came running out of the woods. Bambi was still
thinking it over without stirring. If he went up
to his mother and the others now he would have
to pass by the Prince. He felt as if he couldn’t
do it.</p>

<p>“O well,” he thought, “I don’t have to ask my
mother first. The old Prince spoke to me and I
didn’t tell Mother anything about it. I’ll say,
‘Good morning, Prince.’ He can’t be offended at
that. But if he does get angry, I’ll run away fast.”
Bambi struggled with his resolve which began to
waver again.</p>

<p>Presently the Prince walked out from behind
the hazel bush onto the meadow.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought Bambi.</p>

<p>Then there was a crash like thunder.</p>

<p>Bambi shrank together and didn’t know what
had happened. He saw the Prince leap into the
air under his very nose and watched him rush
past him into the forest with one great bound.</p>

<p>Bambi looked around in a daze. The thunder
still vibrated. He saw how his mother and Aunt
Ena, Gobo and Faline fled into the woods. He
saw how Friend Hare scurried away like mad.
He saw the pheasant running with his neck outstretched.
He noticed that the forest grew suddenly
still. He started and sprang into the thicket.
He had made only a few bounds when he saw
the Prince lying on the ground in front of him,
motionless. Bambi stopped horrified, not understanding
what it meant. The Prince lay bleeding
from a great wound in his shoulder. He was
dead.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop!” a voice beside him commanded.
It was his mother who rushed past him at full gallop.
“Run,” she cried. “Run as fast as you can!”
She did not slow up, but raced ahead, and her command
brought Bambi after her. He ran with all
his might.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mother?” he asked. “What is it,
Mother?”</p>

<p>His mother answered between gasps, “It—was—He!”</p>

<p>Bambi shuddered and they ran on. At last they
stopped for lack of breath.</p>

<p>“What did you say? Tell me, what it was you
said,” a soft voice called down from overhead.
Bambi looked up. The squirrel came chattering
through the branches.</p>

<p>“I ran the whole way with you,” he cried. “It
was dreadful.”</p>

<p>“Were you there?” asked the mother.</p>

<p>“Of course I was there,” the squirrel replied.
“I am still trembling in every limb.” He sat erect,
balancing with his splendid tail, displaying his
small white chest, and holding his forepaws protestingly
against his body. “I’m beside myself
with excitement,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m quite weak from fright myself,” said the
mother. “I don’t understand it. Not one of us
saw a thing.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” the squirrel said pettishly. “I saw
Him long before.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” another voice cried. It was the
magpie. She flew past and settled on a branch.</p>

<p>“So did I,” came a croak from above. It was
the jay who was sitting on an ash.</p>

<p>A couple of crows in the tree-tops cawed
harshly, “We saw Him, too.”</p>

<p>They all sat around talking importantly. They
were unusually excited and seemed to be full of
anger and fear.</p>

<p>“Whom?” Bambi thought. “Whom did they
see?”</p>

<p>“I tried my best,” the squirrel was saying,
pressing his forepaws protestingly against his
heart. “I tried my best to warn the poor Prince.”</p>

<p>“And I,” the jay rasped. “How often did I
scream? But he didn’t care to hear me.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t hear me either,” the magpie
croaked. “I called him at least ten times. I
wanted to fly right past him, for, thought I, he
hasn’t heard me yet; I’ll fly to the hazel bush
where he’s standing. He can’t help hearing me
there. But at that minute it happened.”</p>

<p>“My voice is probably louder than yours, and
I warned him as well as I could,” the crow said
in an impudent tone. “But gentlemen of that
stamp pay little attention to the likes of us.”</p>

<p>“Much too little, really,” the squirrel agreed.</p>

<p>“Well, we did what we could,” said the magpie.
“We’re certainly not to blame when an accident
happens.”</p>

<p>“Such a handsome Prince,” the squirrel lamented.
“And in the very prime of life.”</p>

<p>“Akh!” croaked the jay. “It would have been
better for him if he hadn’t been so proud and had
paid more attention to us.”</p>

<p>“He certainly wasn’t proud.”</p>

<p>“No more so than the other Princes of his
family,” the magpie put in.</p>

<p>“Just plain stupid,” sneered the jay.</p>

<p>“You’re stupid yourself,” the crow cried down
from overhead. “Don’t you talk about stupidity.
The whole forest knows how stupid you are.”</p>

<p>“I!” replied the jay, stiff with astonishment.
“Nobody can accuse me of being stupid. I may
be forgetful but I’m certainly not stupid.”</p>

<p>“O just as you please,” said the crow solemnly.
“Forget what I said to you, but remember that
the Prince did not die because he was proud or
stupid, but because no one can escape Him.”</p>

<p>“Akh!” croaked the jay: “I don’t like that
kind of talk.” He flew away.</p>

<p>The crow went on, “He has already outwitted
many of my family. He kills what He wants.
Nothing can help us.”</p>

<p>“You have to be on your guard against Him,”
the magpie broke in.</p>

<p>“You certainly do,” said the crow sadly. “Good-by.”
He flew off, his family accompanying him.</p>

<p>Bambi looked around. His mother was no
longer there.</p>

<p>“What are they talking about now?” thought
Bambi. “I can’t understand what they are talking
about. Who is this ‘He’ they talk about?
That was He, too, that I saw in the bushes, but
He didn’t kill me.”</p>

<p>Bambi thought of the Prince lying in front of
him with his bloody, mangled shoulder. He was
dead now. Bambi walked along. The forest sang
again with a thousand voices, the sun pierced the
tree-tops with its broad rays. There was light
everywhere. The leaves began to smell. Far
above the falcons called, close at hand a woodpecker
hammered as if nothing had happened.
Bambi was not happy. He felt himself threatened
by something dark. He did not understand how
the others could be so carefree and happy while
life was so difficult and dangerous. Then the
desire seized him to go deeper and deeper into
the woods. They lured him into their depths.
He wanted to find some hiding place where,
shielded on all sides by impenetrable thickets, he
could never be seen. He never wanted to go to
the meadow again.</p>

<p>Something moved very softly in the bushes.
Bambi drew back violently. The old stag was
standing in front of him.</p>

<p>Bambi trembled. He wanted to run away, but
he controlled himself and remained. The old
stag looked at him with his great deep eyes and
asked, “Were you out there before?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bambi said softly. His heart was
pounding in his throat.</p>

<p>“Where is your mother?” asked the stag.</p>

<p>Bambi answered still very softly, “I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>The old stag kept gazing at him. “And still
you’re not calling for her?” he said.</p>

<hr class="chap">

  <div class="caption">
    <p>The old stag kept gazing at him.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Bambi looked into the noble, iron-gray face,
looked at the stag’s antlers and suddenly felt full
of courage. “I can stay by myself, too,” he said.</p>

<p>The old stag considered him for a while; then
he asked gently, “Aren’t you the little one that
was crying for his mother not long ago?”</p>

<p>Bambi was somewhat embarrassed, but his
courage held. “Yes, I am,” he confessed.</p>

<p>The old stag looked at him in silence and it
seemed to Bambi as if those deep eyes gazed still
more mildly. “You scolded me then, Prince,” he
cried excitedly, “because I was afraid of being
left alone. Since then I haven’t been.”</p>

<p>The stag looked at Bambi appraisingly and
smiled a very slight, hardly noticeable smile.
Bambi noticed it however. “Noble Prince,” he
asked confidently, “what has happened? I don’t
understand it. Who is this ‘He’ they are all talking
about?” He stopped, terrified by the dark
glance that bade him be silent.</p>

<p>Another pause ensued. The old stag was gazing
past Bambi into the distance. Then he said
slowly, “Listen, smell and see for yourself. Find
out for yourself.” He lifted his antlered head
still higher. “Farewell,” he said, nothing else.
Then he vanished.</p>

<p>Bambi stood transfixed and wanted to cry. But
that farewell still rang in his ears and sustained
him. Farewell, the old stag had said, so he
couldn’t have been angry.</p>

<p>Bambi felt himself thrill with pride, felt inspired
with a deep earnestness. Yes, life was difficult
and full of danger. But come what might he
would learn to bear it all.</p>

<p>He walked slowly deeper into the forest.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> leaves were falling from the
great oak at the meadow’s edge. They were falling
from all the trees.</p>

<p>One branch of the oak reached high above the
others and stretched far out over the meadow.
Two leaves clung to its very tip.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the way it used to be,” said one leaf
to the other.</p>

<p>“No,” the other leaf answered. “So many of us
have fallen off tonight we’re almost the only ones
left on our branch.”</p>

<p>“You never know who’s going to go next,”
said the first leaf. “Even when it was warm and
the sun shone, a storm or a cloudburst would come
sometimes, and many leaves were torn off, though
they were still young. You never know who’s
going to go next.”</p>

<p>“The sun seldom shines now,” sighed the second
leaf, “and when it does it gives no warmth.
We must have warmth again.”</p>

<p>“Can it be true,” said the first leaf, “can it
really be true, that others come to take our places
when we’re gone and after them still others, and
more and more?”</p>

<p>“It is really true,” whispered the second leaf.
“We can’t even begin to imagine it, it’s beyond
our powers.”</p>

<p>“It makes me very sad,” added the first leaf.</p>

<p>They were silent a while. Then the first leaf
said quietly to herself, “Why must we fall?...”</p>

<p>The second leaf asked, “What happens to us
when we have fallen?”</p>

<p>“We sink down....”</p>

<p>“What is under us?”</p>

<p>The first leaf answered, “I don’t know, some
say one thing, some another, but nobody knows.”</p>

<p>The second leaf asked, “Do we feel anything,
do we know anything about ourselves when we’re
down there?”</p>

<p>The first leaf answered, “Who knows? Not
one of all those down there has ever come back
to tell us about it.”</p>

<p>They were silent again. Then the first leaf said
tenderly to the other, “Don’t worry so much about
it, you’re trembling.”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” the second leaf answered,
“I tremble at the least thing now. I don’t feel
so sure of my hold as I used to.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not talk any more about such things,”
said the first leaf.</p>

<p>The other replied, “No, we’ll let be. But—what
else shall we talk about?” She was silent,
but went on after a little while, “Which of us
will go first?”</p>

<p>“There’s still plenty of time to worry about
that,” the other leaf assured her. “Let’s remember
how beautiful it was, how wonderful, when
the sun came out and shone so warmly that we
thought we’d burst with life. Do you remember?
And the morning dew, and the mild and splendid
nights....”</p>

<p>“Now the nights are dreadful,” the second leaf
complained, “and there is no end to them.”</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t complain,” said the first leaf
gently. “We’ve outlived many, many others.”</p>

<p>“Have I changed much?” asked the second leaf
shyly but determinedly.</p>

<hr class="chap">

    <p>“Have I changed much?” asked the second leaf, shyly but determinedly.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“Not in the least,” the first leaf assured her.
“You only think so because I’ve got to be so
yellow and ugly. But it’s different in your case.”</p>

<p>“You’re fooling me,” the second leaf said.</p>

<p>“No, really,” the first leaf exclaimed eagerly,
“believe me, you’re as lovely as the day you were
born. Here and there may be a little yellow spot
but it’s hardly noticeable and only makes you
handsomer, believe me.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” whispered the second leaf, quite
touched. “I don’t believe you, not altogether, but
I thank you because you’re so kind, you’ve always
been so kind to me. I’m just beginning to understand
how kind you are.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” said the other leaf, and kept silent
herself for she was too troubled to talk any more.</p>

<p>Then they were both silent. Hours passed.</p>

<p>A moist wind blew, cold and hostile, through
the tree-tops.</p>

<p>“Ah, now,” said the second leaf, “I ...” Then
her voice broke off. She was torn from her place
and spun down.</p>

<p>Winter had come.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Bambi</span> noticed that the world was
changed. It was hard for him to get used to this
altered world. They had all lived like rich folk
and now had fallen upon hard times. For Bambi
knew nothing but abundance. He took it for
granted that he would always have plenty to eat.
He thought he would never need to trouble about
food. He believed he would always sleep in the
lovely green-leafed glade where no one could see
him, and would always go about in his smooth,
handsome, glossy red coat.</p>

<p>Now everything was changed without his having
noticed the change take place. The process
that was ending had seemed only a series of episodes
to him. It pleased him to see the milk-white
veils of mist steam from the meadow in the morning,
or drop suddenly from the gray sky at dawn.
They vanished so beautifully in the sunshine. The
hoar frost that covered the meadow with such
dazzling whiteness delighted him too. Sometimes
he liked to listen to his big cousins the elks.
The whole forest would tremble with their kingly
voices. Bambi used to listen and be very much
frightened, but his heart would beat high with
admiration when he heard them calling. He
remembered that the kings had antlers branching
like tall, strong trees. And it seemed to him that
their voices were as powerful as their antlers.
Whenever he heard the deep tones of those voices
he would stand motionless. Their deep voices
rolled towards him like the mighty moaning of
noble, maddened blood whose primal power was
giving utterance to longing, rage and pride.
Bambi struggled in vain against his fears. They
over-powered him whenever he heard those
voices, but he was proud to have such noble relatives.
At the same time he felt a strange sense of
annoyance because they were so unapproachable.
It offended and humiliated him without his knowing
exactly how or why, even without his being
particularly conscious of it.</p>

<p>It was only after the mating season had passed
and the thunder of the stags’ mighty voices had
grown still, that Bambi began to notice other
things once more. At night when he roamed
through the forest or by day as he lay in the
glade, he heard the falling leaves whisper among
the trees. They fluttered and rustled ceaselessly
through the air from all the tree-tops and
branches. A delicate silvery sound was falling
constantly to earth. It was wonderful to awaken
amidst it, wonderful to fall asleep to this mysterious
and melancholy whispering. Soon the leaves
lay thick and loose on the ground and when you
walked through them they flew about, softly rustling.
It was jolly to push them aside with every
step, they were piled so high. It made a sound
like “Sh! sh!”—soft and very clear and silvery.
Besides, it was very useful, for Bambi had to be
particularly careful these days to hear and smell
everything. And with the leaves you could hear
everything far off. They rustled at the slightest
touch and cried, “Sh! sh!” Nobody could steal
through them.</p>

<p>But then the rain came. It poured down from
early morning till late at night. Sometimes it
rained all night long and into the following day.
It would stop for a while and begin again with
fresh strength. The air was damp and cold, the
whole world seemed full of rain. If you tried to
nibble a little meadow grass you got your mouth
full of water, or if you tugged the least little
bit at a bough a whole torrent of water poured
into your eyes and nose. The leaves no longer
rustled. They lay pale and soggy on the ground,
flattened by the rain and made no sounds. Bambi
discovered for the first time how unpleasant it is
to be rained on all day and all night until you
are soaked to the skin. There had not even been
a frost yet, but he longed for the warm weather
and felt it was a sad business to have to run around
soaked through.</p>

<p>But when the north wind blew, Bambi found
out what cold is. It wasn’t much help to nestle
close to his mother. Of course at first he thought
it was wonderful to lie there and keep one side
warm at least. But the north wind raged through
the forest all day and all night long. It seemed
to be driven to madness by some incomprehensible
ice-cold fury, as though it wanted to tear up the
forest by its roots or annihilate it somehow. The
trees groaned in stubborn resistance, they struggled
mightily against the wind’s fierce onslaught.
You could hear their long-drawn moans, their
sigh-like creakings, the loud snap when their
strong limbs split, the angry cracking when now
and again a trunk broke and the vanquished tree
seemed to shriek from every wound in its rent and
dying body. Nothing else could be heard, for the
storm swooped down still more fiercely on the
forest, and its roaring drowned all lesser noises.</p>

<p>Then Bambi knew that want and hardship had
come. He saw how much the rain and wind had
changed the world. There was no longer a leaf
on tree or shrub. But all stood there as though
violated, their bodies naked for all to see. And
they lifted their bare brown limbs to the sky
for pity. The grass on the meadow was withered
and shortened, as if it had sunk into the earth.
Even the glade seemed wretched and bare. Since
the leaves had fallen it was no longer possible
to lie so well hidden as before. The glade was
open on all sides.</p>

<p>One day, as a young magpie flew over the
meadow, something cold and white fell in her
eye. Then it fell again and again. She felt as if
a little veil were drawn across her eye while the
small, pale, blinding white flakes danced around
her. The magpie hesitated in her flight, fluttered
a little, and then soared straight up into the air.
In vain. The cold white flakes were everywhere
and got into her eyes again. She kept flying
straight up, soaring higher.</p>

<p>“Don’t put yourself out so much, dearie,” a
crow who was flying above her in the same direction
called down, “don’t put yourself out so much.
You can’t fly high enough to get outside these
flakes. This is snow.”</p>

<p>“Snow!” cried the magpie in surprise, struggling
against the drizzle.</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it,” said the crow,
“it’s winter, and this is snow.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” the magpie replied, “but I only
left the nest in May. I don’t know anything about
winter.”</p>

<p>“There are plenty in the same boat,” the crow
remarked, “but you’ll soon find out.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the magpie, “if this is snow I
guess I’ll sit down for a while.” She perched on
an elder and shook herself. The crow flew awkwardly
away.</p>

<p>At first Bambi was delighted with the snow.
The air was calm and mild while the white snow-stars
whirled down and the world looked completely
different. It had grown lighter, gayer,
Bambi thought, and whenever the sun came out
for a little while everything shone and the white
covering flashed and sparkled so brightly that it
blinded you.</p>

<p>But Bambi soon stopped being pleased with the
snow. For it grew harder and harder to find food.
He had to paw the snow away with endless labor
before he could find one withered little blade of
grass. The snow crust cut his legs and he was
afraid of cutting his feet. Gobo had already cut
his. Of course Gobo was the kind who couldn’t
stand anything and was a constant source of
trouble to his mother.</p>

<p>The deer were always together now and were
much more friendly than before. Ena brought her
children constantly. Lately Marena, a half-grown
doe, had joined the circle. But old Nettla really
contributed most to their entertainment. She was
quite a self-sufficient person and had her own
ideas about everything. “No,” she would say, “I
don’t bother with children any more. I’ve had
enough of that particular joke.”</p>

<p>Faline asked, “What difference does it make,
if they’re a joke?” And Nettla would act as if she
were angry, and say, “They’re a bad joke, though,
and I’ve had enough of them.”</p>

<p>They got along perfectly together. They would
sit side by side gossiping. The young ones had
never had a chance to hear so much.</p>

<p>Even one or another of the Princes would join
them now. At first things went somewhat stiffly,
especially since the children were a little shy. But
that soon changed, and they got along very well
together. Bambi admired Prince Ronno, who was
a stately lord, and he passionately loved the handsome
young Karus. They had dropped their horns
and Bambi often looked at the two slate-gray
round spots that showed smooth and shimmering
with many delicate points on the Princes’ heads.
They looked very noble.</p>

<p>It was terribly interesting whenever one of the
Princes talked about Him. Ronno had a thick
hide-covered swelling on his left fore-foot. He
limped on that foot and used to ask sometimes,
“Can you really see that I limp?” Everyone
would hasten to assure him that there was not the
trace of a limp. That was what Ronno wanted.
And it really was hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he would go on. “I saved myself from
a tight corner that time.” And then Ronno would
tell how He had surprised him and hurled His
fire at him. But it had only struck his leg. It had
driven him nearly mad with pain, and no wonder,
since the bone was shattered. But Ronno did not
lose his head. He was up and away on three legs.
He pressed on in spite of his weakness for he saw
that he was being pursued. He ran without stopping
until night came. Then he gave himself a
rest. But he went on the next morning until he
felt he was in safety. Then he took care of himself,
living alone in hiding, waiting for his wound
to heal. At last he came out again and was a
hero. He limped, but he thought no one noticed it.</p>

<p>They were often together now for long periods
and told many stories. Bambi heard more about
Him than ever before. They told how terrible He
was to look at. No one could bear to look at His
pale face. Bambi knew that already from his own
experience. They spoke too about His smell, and
again Bambi could have spoken if he had not been
too well brought up to mix in his elders’ conversation.
They said that His smell differed each
time in a hundred subtle ways and yet you could
tell it in an instant, for it was always exciting,
unfathomable, mysterious and terrible.</p>

<p>They told how He used only two legs to walk
with and they spoke of the amazing strength of
His two hands. Some of them did not know what
hands were. But when it was explained, old Nettla
said, “I don’t see anything so surprising in that. A
squirrel can do everything you tell about just as
well, and every little mouse can perform the same
wonders.” She turned away her head disdainfully.</p>

<p>“O no,” cried the others, and they gave her
to understand that those were <span class='it'>not</span> the same things
at all. But old Nettla was not to be cowed. “What
about the falcon?” she exclaimed. “And the buzzard?
And the owl? They’ve got only two legs
and when they want to catch something they
simply stand on one leg and grab with the other.
That’s much harder and He certainly can’t do
that.”</p>

<p>Old Nettla was not at all inclined to admire
anything connected with Him. She hated Him
with all her heart. “He is loathsome!” she said,
and she stuck to that. Besides, nobody contradicted
her, since nobody liked Him.</p>

<p>But the talk grew more complicated when they
told how He had a third hand, not two hands
merely, but a third hand.</p>

<p>“That’s an old story,” Nettla said curtly. “I
don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Ronno broke in. “Then what did
He shatter my leg with? Can you tell me that?”</p>

<p>Old Nettla answered carelessly, “That’s your
affair, my dear, He’s never shattered any of
mine.”</p>

<p>Aunt Ena said, “I’ve seen a good deal in my
time, and I think there’s something in the story
that He has a third hand.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” young Karus said politely.
“I have a friend, a crow ...” He paused, embarrassed
for a moment, and looked around at
them, one after the other, as though he were
afraid of being laughed at. But when he saw that
they were listening attentively to him he went
on. “This crow is unusually well informed, I must
say that. Surprisingly well informed. And she says
that He really has three hands, but not always.
The third hand is the bad one, the crow says. It
isn’t attached like the other two, but He carries it
hanging over His shoulder. The crow says that
she can always tell exactly when He, or anyone
like Him, is going to be dangerous. If He comes
without the third hand He isn’t dangerous.”</p>

<p>Old Nettla laughed. “Your crow’s a blockhead,
my dear Karus,” she said. “Tell her so for me. If
she were as clever as she thinks she is, she’d know
that He’s always dangerous, always.” But the
others had different objections.</p>

<p>Bambi’s mother said, “Some of Them aren’t
dangerous; you can see that at a glance.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” old Nettla asked. “I suppose you
stand still till They come up to you and wish you
a good day?”</p>

<p>Bambi’s mother answered gently. “Of course
I don’t stand still; I run away.”</p>

<p>And Faline broke in with, “You should always
run away.” Everybody laughed.</p>

<p>But when they talked about the third hand they
became serious and fear grew on them gradually.
For whatever it might be, a third hand or something
else, it was terrible and they did not understand
it. They only knew of it from others’ stories,
few of them had ever seen it for themselves. He
would stand still, far off, and never move. You
couldn’t explain what He did or how it happened,
but suddenly there would be a crash like thunder,
fire would shoot out and far away from Him you
would drop down dying with your breast torn
open. They all sat bowed while they talked about
Him, as though they felt the presence of some
dark, unknown power controlling them.</p>

<p>They listened curiously to the many stories that
were always horrible, full of blood and suffering.
They listened tirelessly to everything that
was said about Him, tales that were certainly invented,
all the stories and sayings that had come
down from their fathers and great-grandfathers.
In each one of them they were unconsciously seeking
for some way to propitiate this dark power,
or some way to escape it.</p>

<p>“What difference does it make,” young Karus
asked quite despondently, “how far away He is
when He kills you?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t your clever crow explain that to you?”
old Nettla mocked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Karus with a smile. “She says that
she’s often seen Him but no one can explain Him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, He knocks the crows out of the trees, too,
when He wants to,” Ronno observed.</p>

<p>“And He brings down the pheasant on the
wing,” Aunt Ena added.</p>

<p>Bambi’s mother said, “He throws His hand at
you, my grandmother told me so.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked old Nettla. “What is it that
bangs so terribly then?”</p>

<p>“That’s when He tears His hand off,” Bambi’s
mother explained. “Then the fire flashes and the
thunder cracks. He’s all fire inside.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Ronno. “It’s true that He’s
all fire inside. But that about His hand is wrong.
A hand couldn’t make such wounds. You can see
that for yourself. It’s much more likely that it’s
a tooth He throws at us. A tooth would explain
a great many things, you know. You really die
from His bite.”</p>

<p>“Will He never stop hunting us?” young
Karus sighed.</p>

<p>Then Marena spoke, the young half-grown doe.
“They say that sometime He’ll come to live with
us and be as gentle as we are. He’ll play with us
then and the whole forest will be happy, and we’ll
be friends with Him.”</p>

<p>Old Nettla burst out laughing. “Let Him stay
where He is and leave us in peace,” she said.</p>

<p>Aunt Ena said reprovingly, “You shouldn’t talk
that way.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” old Nettla replied hotly, “I
really don’t see why not. Friends with Him! He’s
murdered us ever since we can remember, every
one of us, our sisters, our mothers, our brothers!
Ever since we came into the world He’s given us
no peace, but has killed us wherever we showed
our heads. And now we’re going to be friends
with Him. What nonsense!”</p>

<p>Marena looked at all of them out of her big,
calm, shining eyes. “Love is no nonsense,” she
said. “It has to come.”</p>

<p>Old Nettla turned away. “I’m going to look
for something to eat,” she said, and trotted off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Winter</span> dragged on. Sometimes it was
warmer, but then the snow would fall again
and lie deeper and deeper, so that it became impossible
to scrape it away. It was worse when the
thaws came and the melted snow water froze
again in the night. Then there was a thin slippery
film of ice. Often it broke in pieces and the
sharp splinters cut the deer’s tender fetlocks till
they bled.</p>

<p>A heavy frost had set in several days before.
The air was purer and rarer than it had ever
been, and full of energy. It began to hum in a
very fine high tone. It hummed with the cold.</p>

<p>It was silent in the woods, but something horrible
happened every day. Once the crows fell
upon Friend Hare’s small son who was lying sick,
and killed him in a cruel way. He could be heard
moaning pitifully for a long while. Friend Hare
was not at home, and when he heard the sad news
he was beside himself with grief.</p>

<p>Another time the squirrel raced about with a
great wound in his neck where the ferret had
caught him. By a miracle the squirrel had escaped.
He could not talk because of the pain, but he
ran up and down the branches. Everyone could
see him. He ran like mad. From time to time he
stopped, sat down, raised his forepaws desperately
and clutched his head in terror and agony
while the red blood oozed on his white chest. He
ran about for an hour, then suddenly crumpled
up, fell across a branch, and dropped dead in the
snow. A couple of magpies flew down at once to
begin their meal.</p>

<p>Another day a fox tore to pieces the strong and
handsome pheasant who had enjoyed such general
respect and popularity. His death aroused the
sympathies of a wide circle who tried to comfort
his disconsolate widow.</p>

<p>The fox had dragged the pheasant out of the
snow, where he was buried, thinking himself well
hidden. No one could have felt safer than the
pheasant for it all happened in broad daylight.
The terrible hardship that seemed to have no end
spread bitterness and brutality. It destroyed all
their memories of the past, their faith in each other,
and ruined every good custom they had. There
was no longer either peace or mercy in the forest.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to believe that it will ever be better,”
Bambi’s mother sighed.</p>

<p>Aunt Ena sighed too. “It’s hard to believe that
it was ever any better,” she said.</p>

<p>“And yet,” Marena said, looking in front of
her, “I always think how beautiful it was before.”</p>

<p>“Look,” old Nettla said to Aunt Ena, “your
little one is trembling.” She pointed to Gobo.
“Does he always tremble like that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Aunt Ena answered gravely, “he’s
shivered that way for the last few days.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said old Nettla in her frank way, “I’m
glad that I have no more children. If that little
one were mine I’d wonder if he’d last out the
winter.”</p>

<p>The future really didn’t look very bright for
Gobo. He was weak. He had always been much
more delicate than Bambi or Faline and remained
smaller than either of them. He was growing
worse from day to day. He could not eat even
the little food there was. It made his stomach
ache. And he was quite exhausted by the cold, and
by the horrors around him. He shivered more
and more and could hardly stand up. Everyone
looked at him sympathetically.</p>

<p>Old Nettla went up to him and nudged him
good-naturedly. “Don’t be so sad,” she said encouragingly,
“that’s no way for a little prince
to act, and besides it’s unhealthy.” She turned
away so that no one should see how moved she was.</p>

<p>Ronno who had settled himself a little to one
side in the snow suddenly sprang up. “I don’t
know what it is,” he mumbled and gazed around.</p>

<p>Everyone grew watchful. “What is it?” they
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Ronno repeated. “But I’m
restless. I suddenly felt restless as if something
were wrong.”</p>

<p>Karus was snuffing the air. “I don’t smell anything
strange,” he declared.</p>

<p>They all stood still, listening and snuffing the
air. “It’s nothing, there’s absolutely nothing to
smell,” they agreed one after another.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” Ronno insisted, “you can say
what you like, something is wrong.”</p>

<p>Marena said, “The crows are calling.”</p>

<p>“There they go calling again,” Faline added
quickly, but the others had already heard them.</p>

<p>“They are flying,” said Karus and the others.</p>

<p>Everybody looked up. High above the tree-tops
a flock of crows flapped by. They came from the
farthest edge of the forest, the direction from
which danger always came, and they were complaining
to one another. Apparently something
unusual had happened.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I right?” asked Ronno. “You can see
that something is happening.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” Bambi’s mother whispered
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Let’s get away,” Aunt Ena urged in alarm.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Ronno commanded.</p>

<p>“But the children,” Aunt Ena replied, “the
children. Gobo can’t run.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” Ronno agreed, “go off with your children.
I don’t think there’s any need for it, but I don’t
blame you for going.” He was alert and serious.</p>

<p>“Come, Gobo. Come, Faline. Softly now, go
slowly. And keep behind me,” Aunt Ena warned
them. She slipped away with the children.</p>

<p>Time passed. They stood still, listening and
trembling.</p>

<p>“As if we hadn’t suffered enough already,”
old Nettla began. “We still have this to go
through....” She was very angry. Bambi
looked at her, and he felt that she was thinking of
something horrible.</p>

<p>Three or four magpies had already begun to
chatter on the side of the thicket from which the
crows had come. “Look out! Look out, out, out!”
they cried. The deer could not see them, but could
hear them calling and warning each other. Sometimes
one of them, and sometimes all of them
together, would cry, “Look out, out, out!” Then
they came nearer. They fluttered in terror from
tree to tree, peered back and fluttered away again
in fear and alarm.</p>

<p>“Akh!” cried the jays. They screamed their
warning loudly.</p>

<p>Suddenly all the deer shrank together at once
as though a blow had struck them. Then they
stood still snuffing the air.</p>

<p>It was He.</p>

<p>A heavy wave of scent blew past. There was
nothing they could do. The scent filled their nostrils,
it numbed their senses and made their hearts
stop beating.</p>

<p>The magpies were still chattering. The jays
were still screaming overhead. In the woods
around them everything had sprung to life. The
tit-mice flitted through the branches, like tiny
feathered balls, chirping, “Run! run!”</p>

<p>The blackbirds fled swiftly and darkly above
them with long-drawn twittering cries. Through
the dark tangle of bare bushes, they saw on the
white snow a wild aimless scurrying of smaller,
shadowy creatures. These were the pheasants.
Then a flash of red streaked by. That was the fox.
But no one was afraid of him now. For that fearful
scent kept streaming on in a wider wave, sending
terror into their hearts and uniting them all
in one mad fear, in a single feverish impulse to
flee, to save themselves.</p>

<p>That mysterious overpowering scent filled the
woods with such strength that they knew that this
time He was not alone, but had come with many
others, and there would be no end to the killing.</p>

<p>They did not move. They looked at the tit-mice,
whisking away in a sudden flutter, at the
blackbirds and the squirrels who dashed from
tree-top to tree-top in mad bounds. They knew
that all the little creatures on the ground had
nothing to fear. But they understood their flight
when they smelt Him, for no forest creature
could bear His presence.</p>

<p>Presently Friend Hare hopped up. He hesitated,
sat still and then hopped on again.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Karus called after him impatiently.</p>

<p>But Friend Hare only looked around with bewildered
eyes and could not even speak. He was
completely terrified.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of asking?” said Ronno
gloomily.</p>

<p>Friend Hare gasped for breath. “We are surrounded,”
he said in a lifeless voice. “We can’t
escape on any side. He is everywhere.”</p>

<p>At the same instant they heard His voice.
Twenty or thirty strong, He cried, “Ho! ho!
Ha! ha!” It roared like the sound of winds and
storms. He beat on the tree trunks as though they
were drums. It was wracking and terrifying. A
distant twisting and rending of parted bushes
rang out. There was a snapping and cracking of
broken boughs.</p>

<p>He was coming.</p>

<p>He was coming into the heart of the thicket.</p>

<p>Then short whistling flute-like trills sounded
together with the loud flap of soaring wings. A
pheasant rose from under His very feet. The deer
heard the wing-beats of the pheasant grow fainter
as he mounted into the air. There was a loud
crash like thunder. Then silence. Then a dull
thud on the ground.</p>

<p>“He is dead,” said Bambi’s mother, trembling.</p>

<p>“The first,” Ronno added.</p>

<p>The young doe, Marena, said, “In this very
hour many of us are going to die. Perhaps I shall
be one of them.” No one listened to her, for a
mad terror had seized them all.</p>

<p>Bambi tried to think. But His savage noises
grew louder and louder and paralyzed Bambi’s
senses. He heard nothing but those noises. They
numbed him while amidst the howling, shouting
and crashing he could hear his own heart pounding.
He felt nothing but curiosity and did not
even realize that he was trembling in every limb.
From time to time his mother whispered in his
ear, “Stay close to me.” She was shouting, but in
the uproar it sounded to Bambi as if she were
whispering. Her “Stay close to me,” encouraged
him. It was like a chain holding him. Without
it he would have rushed off senselessly, and he
heard it at the very moment when his wits were
wandering and he wanted to dash away.</p>

<p>He looked around. All sorts of creatures were
swarming past, scampering blindly over one another.
A pair of weasels ran by like thin snake-like
streaks. The eye could scarcely follow them.
A ferret listened as though bewitched to every
shriek that desperate Friend Hare let out.</p>

<p>A fox was standing in a whole flurry of fluttering
pheasants. They paid no attention to him.
They ran right under his nose and he paid no attention
to them. Motionless, with his head thrust
forward, he listened to the onrushing tumult, lifting
his pointed ears and snuffed the air with his
nose. Only his tail moved, slowly wagging with
his intense concentration.</p>

<p>A pheasant dashed up. He had come from
where the danger was worst, and was beside
himself with fear.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to fly,” he shouted to the others.
“Don’t fly, just run! Don’t lose your head! Don’t
try to fly! Just run, run, run!”</p>

<p>He kept repeating the same thing over and over
again as though to encourage himself. But he no
longer knew what he was saying.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ha! ha!” came the death cry from
quite near apparently.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose your head,” screamed the pheasant.
And at the same time his voice broke in a
whistling gasp and, spreading his wings, he flew
up with a loud whir. Bambi watched how he flew
straight up, directly between the trees, beating his
wings. The dark metallic blue and greenish-brown
markings on his body gleamed like gold. His long
tail feathers swept proudly behind him. A short
crash like thunder sounded sharply. The pheasant
suddenly crumpled up in mid-flight. He turned
head over tail as though he wanted to catch his
claws with his beak, and then dropped violently
to earth. He fell among the others and did not
move again.</p>

<p>Then everyone lost his senses. They all rushed
toward one another. Five or six pheasants rose at
one time with a loud whir. “Don’t fly,” cried the
rest and ran. The thunder cracked five or six
times and more of the flying birds dropped lifeless
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Bambi’s mother. Bambi looked
around. Ronno and Karus had already fled. Old
Nettla was disappearing. Only Marena was still
beside them. Bambi went with his mother, Marena
following them timidly. All around them was a
roaring and shouting, and the thunder was crashing.
Bambi’s mother was calm. She trembled
quietly but she kept her wits together.</p>

<p>“Bambi, my child,” she said, “keep behind me
all the time. We’ll have to get out of here and
across the open place. But now we’ll go slowly.”</p>

<p>The din was maddening. The thunder crashed
ten, twelve times as He hurled it from His hands.</p>

<p>“Watch out,” said Bambi’s mother. “Don’t run.
But when we have to cross the open place, run as
fast as you can. And don’t forget, Bambi, my
child, don’t pay any attention to me when we get
out there. Even if I fall, don’t pay any attention
to me, just keep on running. Do you understand,
Bambi?”</p>

<p>His mother walked carefully step by step amidst
the uproar. The pheasants were running up and
down, burying themselves in the snow. Suddenly
they would spring out and begin to run again. The
whole Hare family was hopping to and fro, squatting
down and then hopping again. No one said a
word. They were all spent with terror and
numbed by the din and thunderclaps.</p>

<p>It grew lighter in front of Bambi and his
mother. The clearing showed through the bushes.
Behind them the terrifying drumming on the tree
trunks came crashing nearer and nearer. The
breaking branches snapped. There was a roaring
of “Ha, ha! Ho, ho!”</p>

<p>Then Friend Hare and two of his cousins rushed
past them across the clearing. Bing! Ping! Bang!
roared the thunder. Bambi saw how Friend Hare
struck an elder in the middle of his flight and
lay with his white belly turned upward. He quivered
a little and then was still. Bambi stood petrified.
But from behind him came the cry, “Here
they are! Run! Run!”</p>

<p>There was a loud clapping of wings suddenly
opened. There were gasps, sobs, showers of
feathers, flutterings. The pheasants took wing and
the whole flock rose almost at one instant. The
air was throbbing with repeated thunderclaps
and the dull thuds of the fallen and the high,
piercing shrieks of those who had escaped.</p>

<p>Bambi heard steps and looked behind him.
He was there. He came bursting through the
bushes on all sides. He sprang up everywhere,
struck about Him, beat the bushes, drummed on
the tree trunks and shouted with a fiendish
voice.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Bambi’s mother. “Get away from
here. And don’t stay too close to me.” She was
off with a bound that barely skimmed the snow.
Bambi rushed out after her. The thunder crashed
around them on all sides. It seemed as if the earth
would split in half. Bambi saw nothing. He kept
running. A growing desire to get away from the
tumult and out of reach of that scent which
seemed to strangle him, the growing impulse to
flee, the longing to save himself were loosed in
him at last. He ran. It seemed to him as if he saw
his mother hit but he did not know if it was really
she or not. He felt a film come over his eyes from
fear of the thunder crashing behind him. It had
gripped him completely at last. He could think
of nothing or see nothing around him. He kept
running.</p>

<p>The open space was crossed. Another thicket
took him in. The hue and cry still rang behind
him. The sharp reports still thundered. And in
the branches above him there was a light pattering
like the first fall of hail. Then it grew quieter.
Bambi kept running.</p>

<p>A dying pheasant, with its neck twisted, lay on
the snow, beating feebly with its wings. When
he heard Bambi coming he ceased his convulsive
movements and whispered: “It’s all over with
me.” Bambi paid no attention to him and ran on.</p>

<p>A tangle of bushes he blundered into forced him
to slacken his pace and look for a path. He pawed
the ground impatiently with his hoofs. “This
way!” called someone with a gasping voice.
Bambi obeyed involuntarily and found an opening
at once. Someone moved feebly in front of
him. It was Friend Hare’s wife who had called.</p>

<p>“Can you help me a little?” she said. Bambi
looked at her and shuddered. Her hind leg
dangled lifelessly in the snow, dyeing it red and
melting it with warm, oozing blood. “Can you
help me a little?” she repeated. She spoke as if
she were well and whole, almost as if she were
happy. “I don’t know what can have happened to
me,” she went on. “There’s really no sense to it,
but I just can’t seem to walk....”</p>

<p>In the middle of her words she rolled over on
her side and died. Bambi was seized with horror
again and ran.</p>

<p>“Bambi!”</p>

<p>He stopped with a jolt. A deer was calling him.
Again he heard the cry. “Is that you, Bambi?”</p>

<p>Bambi saw Gobo floundering helplessly in the
snow. All his strength was gone; he could no
longer stand on his feet. He lay there half buried
and lifted his head feebly. Bambi went up to him
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Where’s your mother, Gobo?” he asked, gasping
for breath. “Where’s Faline?” Bambi spoke
quickly and impatiently. Terror still gripped his
heart.</p>

<p>“Mother and Faline had to go on,” Gobo answered
resignedly. He spoke softly, but as seriously
and as well as a grown deer. “They had to
leave me here. I fell down. You must go on, too,
Bambi.”</p>

<p>“Get up,” cried Bambi. “Get up, Gobo! You’ve
rested long enough. There’s not a minute to lose
now. Get up and come with me!”</p>

<p>“No, leave me,” Gobo answered quietly. “I
can’t stand up. It’s impossible. I’d like to, but
I’m too weak.”</p>

<p>“What will happen to you?” Bambi persisted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Probably I’ll die,” said Gobo
simply.</p>

<p>The uproar began again and re-echoed. New
crashes of thunder followed. Bambi shrank together.
Suddenly a branch snapped. Young Karus
pounded swiftly through the snow, galloping
ahead of the din.</p>

<p>“Run,” he called when he saw Bambi. “Don’t
stand there if you can run!” He was gone in a
flash and his headlong flight carried Bambi along
with it. Bambi was hardly aware that he had
begun to run again and only after an interval did
he say, “Good-by, Gobo.” But he was already too
far away. Gobo could no longer hear him.</p>

    <p>Bambi was hardly aware that he had begun to run again.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>He ran till nightfall through the woods that
was filled with shouting and thunder. As darkness
closed in, it grew quiet. Soon a light wind
carried away the horrible scent that spread everywhere.
But the excitement remained.</p>

<p>The first friend whom Bambi saw again was
Ronno. He was limping more than ever.</p>

<p>“Over in the oak grove the fox has a burning
fever from his wound,” Ronno said. “I just passed
him. He’s suffering terribly. He keeps biting the
snow and the ground.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen my mother?” asked Bambi.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ronno evasively, and walked
quickly away.</p>

<p>Later during the night Bambi met old Nettla
with Faline. All three were delighted to meet.</p>

<p>“Have you seen my mother?” asked Bambi.</p>

<p>“No,” Faline answered. “I don’t even know
where my own mother is.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said old Nettla cheerfully. “Here’s a
nice mess. I was so glad that I didn’t have to
bother with children any more and now I have to
look after two at once. I’m heartily grateful.”</p>

<p>Bambi and Faline laughed.</p>

<p>They talked about Gobo. Bambi told how he
had found him, and they grew so sad they began
to cry. But old Nettla would not have them crying.
“Before everything else you have got to get
something to eat. I never heard of such a thing.
You haven’t had a bite to eat this livelong day!”</p>

<p>She led them to places where there were still a
few leaves that had not completely withered. Old
Nettla was wonderfully gentle. She ate nothing
herself, but made Bambi and Faline eat heartily.
She pawed away the snow from the grassy spots
and ordered them to eat with, “The grass is good
here.” Or else she would say, “No, wait. We’ll
find something better farther on.” But between
whiles she would grumble. “It’s perfectly ridiculous
the trouble children give you.”</p>

<p>Suddenly they saw Aunt Ena coming and rushed
towards her. “Aunt Ena,” cried Bambi. He had
seen her first. Faline was beside herself with joy
and bounded around her. “Mother,” she cried.
But Ena was weeping and nearly dead from exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Gobo is gone,” she cried. “I’ve looked for him.
I went to the little place where he lay when he broke
down in the snow ... there was nothing there ... he is gone ... my poor little Gobo....”</p>

<p>Old Nettla grumbled, “If you had looked for
his tracks it would have been more sensible than
crying,” she said.</p>

<p>“There weren’t any tracks,” said Aunt Ena.
“But ... His ... tracks were there. He found
Gobo.”</p>

<p>She was silent. Then Bambi asked despondently,
“Aunt Ena, have you seen my mother?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Aunt Ena gently.</p>

<p>Bambi never saw his mother again.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>At</span> last the willows shed their catkins.
Everything was turning green, but the young
leaves on the trees and bushes were still tiny.
Glowing with the soft, early morning light they
looked fresh and smiling like children who have
just awakened from sleep.</p>

<p>Bambi was standing in front of a hazel bush,
beating his new antlers against the wood. It was
very pleasant to do that. And an absolute necessity
besides, since skin and hide still covered his
splendid antlers. The skin had to come off, of
course, and no sensible creature would ever wait
until it split of its own accord. Bambi pounded
his antlers till the skin split and long strips of it
dangled about his ears. As he pounded on the
hazel stems again and again, he felt how much
stronger his antlers were than the wood. This
feeling shot through him in a rush of power and
pride. He beat more fiercely on the hazel bush
and tore its bark into long pieces. The white body
of the tree showed naked and quickly turned a
rusty red in the open air. But Bambi paid no
attention to that. He saw the bright wood of the
tree flash under his strokes and it heartened him.
A whole row of hazel bushes bore traces of his
work.</p>

<p>“Well, you are nearly grown now,” said a
cheerful voice close by.</p>

<p>Bambi tossed his head and looked around him.
There sat the squirrel observing him in a friendly
way. From overhead came a short, shrill laugh,
“Ha! Ha!”</p>

<p>Bambi and the squirrel were both half frightened.
But the woodpecker who was clinging to an
oak trunk called down, “Excuse me, but I always
have to laugh when I see you deer acting like
that.”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus12.jpg" alt="" id="illus12">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>“Excuse me,” said the woodpecker, “but I always have to laugh when I see you deer acting like that.”</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“What is there to laugh at?” asked Bambi
politely.</p>

<p>“O!” said the woodpecker, “you go at things
in such a wrong-headed way. In the first place,
you ought to try big trees, for you can’t get anything
out of those little wisps of hazel stalks.”</p>

<p>“What should I get out of them?” Bambi asked.</p>

<p>“Bugs,” said the woodpecker with a laugh.
“Bugs and grubs. Look, do like this.” He
drummed on the oak trunk, tack! tack! tack! tack!</p>

<p>The squirrel rushed up and scolded him.
“What are you talking about?” he said. “The
Prince isn’t looking for bugs and grubs.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said the woodpecker in high glee.
“They taste fine.” He bit a bug in half, swallowed
it and began drumming again.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” the squirrel went on
scolding. “A noble lord like that has far other,
far higher aims. You’re only casting reflection
on yourself by such talk.”</p>

<p>“It’s all the same to me,” answered the woodpecker.
“A fig for higher aims,” he cried cheerfully
and fluttered away. The squirrel bustled
down again.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember me?” he said putting on
a pleased expression.</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Bambi in a friendly
way. “Do you live up there?” he asked pointing
to the oak.</p>

<p>The squirrel looked at him good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“You’re mixing me up with my grandmother,”
he said. “I knew you were mixing me up with
her. My grandmother used to live up there when
you were just a baby, Prince Bambi. She often
told me about you. The ferret killed her long
ago, last winter, you may remember it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bambi nodded. “I’ve heard about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, afterwards my father settled here,” the
squirrel went on. He sat erect and held both
forepaws politely over his white chest. “But
maybe you’ve got me mixed up with my father,
too. Did you know my father?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Bambi replied. “But I never
had that pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” the squirrel exclaimed satisfied.
“Father was so surly and so shy. He had nothing
to do with anybody.”</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” Bambi inquired.</p>

<p>“O,” said the squirrel, “the owl caught him a
month ago. Yes.... And now I’m living up
there myself. I’m quite content, since I was born
up there.”</p>

<p>Bambi turned to go.</p>

<p>“Wait,” cried the squirrel quickly, “I didn’t
mean to talk about all that. I wanted to say something
quite different.”</p>

<p>Bambi stopped. “What is it?” he asked patiently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squirrel, “what is it?” He
thought a little while and then gave a quick skip
and sat erect, balancing with his splendid tail.
He looked at Bambi. “Right you are,” he chattered
on. “Now I know what it was. I wanted
to say that your antlers are almost grown now,
and that you are going to be a remarkably handsome
person.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” said Bambi joyfully.</p>

<p>“Remarkably handsome,” cried the squirrel,
and pressed his forepaws rapturously against his
white chest. “So tall, so stately and with such
long bright prongs to your antlers. You don’t
often see the like.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Bambi asked. He was so delighted
that he immediately began to beat the hazel stems
again. He tore off long ribbons of bark.</p>

<p>All the while the squirrel kept on talking. “I
must say that very few have antlers like those at
your age. It doesn’t seem possible. I saw you
several times from a distance last summer, and I
can hardly believe that you’re the same creature,
you were such a thin little shaver then.”</p>

<p>Bambi suddenly grew silent. “Good-by,” he
said hastily. “I have to go now.” And he ran off.</p>

<p>He didn’t like to be reminded of last summer.
He had had a difficult time of it since then. At
first, after his mother’s disappearance, he had felt
quite lost. The long winter was interminable.
Spring came hesitatingly and it was late before
things began to turn green. Without old Nettla
Bambi might not even have pulled through at all,
but she looked after him and helped him where
she could. In spite of that he was alone a good
deal.</p>

<p>He missed Gobo at every turn; poor Gobo,
who was dead too, like the rest of them. Bambi
thought of him often during that winter, and for
the first time he really began to appreciate how
good and lovable Gobo had been.</p>

<p>He seldom saw Faline. She stayed with her
mother most of the time, and seemed to have
grown unusually shy. Later when it had finally
grown warm Bambi began to feel his old self
once more. He flourished his first antler on high
and was very proud of it. But bitter disappointment
soon followed.</p>

<p>The other bucks chased him whenever they saw
him. They drove him away angrily. They would
not let him come near them until finally he was
afraid to take a step for fear of being caught.
He was afraid to show himself anywhere and
slunk along hidden trails in a very downcast
frame of mind.</p>

<p>As the summer days grew warmer a remarkable
restlessness seized him. His heart felt more
and more oppressed with a sense of longing that
was both pleasant and painful. Whenever he
chanced to see Faline or one of her friends,
though only at a distance, a rush of incomprehensible
excitement crept over him. Often it happened
that he recognized her track, or the air he
snuffed told him she was near. Then he would
feel himself irresistibly drawn towards her. But
when he gave way to his desire he always came to
grief. Either he met no one and, after wandering
around for a long while, had to admit that they
were avoiding him, or he ran across one of the
bucks who immediately sprang at him, beat and
kicked him and chased him disgracefully away.
Ronno and Karus had treated him worst of all.
No, that hadn’t been a happy time.</p>

<p>And now the squirrel had stupidly reminded
him of it. Suddenly he became quite wild and
started to run. The tit-mice and hedge sparrows
flitted, frightened, through the bushes as he
passed, and asked each other in a fluster, “What
was that?” Bambi did not hear them. A couple
of magpies chattered nervously, “What happened?”
The jay cried angrily, “What is the
matter with you?” Bambi paid no attention to
him. Overhead the yellow-bird sang from tree to
tree, “Good morning, I’m ha-appy.” Bambi did
not answer. The thicket was very bright and shot
through with sunbeams. Bambi did not stop to
think about such things.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud whir of wings. A
whole rainbow of gorgeous colors flashed from
under Bambi’s very feet and shone so close to his
eyes that he stopped, dazzled. It was Jonello, the
pheasant. He had flown up in terror, for Bambi
had nearly stepped on him. He fled away scolding.</p>

<p>“I never heard of such a thing,” he cried in his
split, cackling voice. Bambi stood still in astonishment
and stared after him.</p>

<p>“It turned out all right this time, but it really
was inconsiderate,” said a soft, twittering voice
close to the ground. It was Jonellina, the pheasant’s
wife. She was sitting on the ground, hovering
over her eggs. “My husband was terribly
frightened,” she went on in an irritable tone.
“And so was I. But I don’t dare stir from this
spot. I wouldn’t stir from this spot no matter
what happened. You could step on me and I
wouldn’t move.”</p>

<p>Bambi was a little embarrassed. “I beg your
pardon,” he stammered, “I didn’t mean to do it.”</p>

<p>“O, not at all,” the pheasant’s wife replied.
“It was nothing so dreadful after all. But my
husband and I are so nervous at present. You can
understand why....”</p>

<p>Bambi didn’t understand why at all and went
on. He was quieter now. The forest sang around
him. The light grew more radiant and warmer.
The leaves on the bushes, the grass underfoot and
the moist, steaming earth began to smell more
sweetly. Bambi’s young strength swelled within
him and streamed through all his limbs so that
he walked around stiffly with awkward restrained
movements like a mechanical thing.</p>

<p>He went up to a low alder shrub and, lifting
his feet high, beat on the earth with such savage
blows that the dirt flew. His two sharp-pointed
hoofs cut the turf that grew there. They scraped
away the wood-vetch and leeks, the violets and
snowbells, till the bare earth was furrowed in
front of him. Every blow sounded dully.</p>

<p>Two moles, who were grubbing among the
tangled roots of an old sycamore tree, grew anxious
and, looking out, saw Bambi.</p>

<p>“That’s a ridiculous way to do things,” said
one mole. “Who ever heard of anybody digging
that way?”</p>

<p>The other mole drew down one corner of his
mouth in a scornful sneer. “He doesn’t know anything,
you can see that right off,” he said. “But
that’s the way it is when people meddle with
things they know nothing about.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Bambi listened, tossed up his head,
listened again, and peered through the leaves. A
flash of red showed through the branches. The
prongs of an antler gleamed indistinctly. Bambi
snorted. Whoever it might be who was circling
around him, whether it was Karus or somebody
else, didn’t matter. “Forward!” thought Bambi as
he charged. “I’ll show them that I’m not afraid of
them,” he thought as though suddenly exultant.
“I’ll show them that they’d better look out for me.”</p>

<p>The branches rustled with the fury of his
charge, the bushes cracked and broke. Then
Bambi saw the other deer right in front of him.
He did not recognize him, for everything was
swimming before his eyes. He thought of nothing
but “Forward!” His antlers lowered, he rushed
on. All his strength was concentrated in his
shoulders. He was ready for the blow. Then he
smelt his opponent’s hide. But he saw nothing
ahead of him but the red wall of his flank. Then
the other stag made a very slight turn and Bambi,
not meeting the resistance he expected, charged
past him into the empty air. He nearly went
head over heels. He staggered, pulled himself
together and made ready for a fresh onslaught.</p>

<p>Then he recognized the old stag.</p>

<p>Bambi was so astonished that he lost his self-possession.
He was ashamed to run away as he
would have liked to do. But he was also ashamed
to stay there. He didn’t move.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the old stag, quietly and gently.
His voice was so frank and yet so commanding
it pierced Bambi to the heart. He was silent.</p>

<p>“Well?” the old stag repeated.</p>

<p>“I thought ...” Bambi stammered, “I
thought ... it was Ronno ... or ...” He
stopped and risked a shy glance at the old stag.
And this glance confused him still more. The old
stag stood motionless and powerful. His head
had turned completely white by now, and his
proud dark eyes glowed in their depths.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you charge me...?” the old
stag asked.</p>

<p>Bambi looked at him, filled with a wonderful
ecstasy, and shaken by a mysterious tremor. He
wanted to cry out, “It’s because I love you,” but
he merely answered, “I don’t know....”</p>

<p>The old stag looked at him. “It’s a long time
since I’ve seen you,” he said. “You’ve grown big
and strong.”</p>

<p>Bambi did not answer. He trembled with joy.
The old stag went on examining him critically.
Then he came unexpectedly up to Bambi who
was terribly frightened.</p>

<p>“Act bravely,” said the old stag.</p>

<p>He turned around and in the next moment had
disappeared. Bambi remained in that place for
a long while.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>It</span> was summer and sizzling hot. The
same longing he had felt before began to stir
again in Bambi. But much more strongly now
than then. It seethed in his blood and made him
restless. He strayed far afield.</p>

<p>One day he met Faline. He met her quite unexpectedly,
for his thoughts were so confused, his
senses so clouded by the restless desire that raged
within him, that he did not even recognize Faline.
She was standing in front of him. Bambi stared
at her speechless for a while. Then he said as
though fascinated, “How beautiful you have
grown, Faline!”</p>

<p>“So you recognized me again?” Faline replied.</p>

<p>“How could I help recognizing you?” cried
Bambi. “Didn’t we grow up together?”</p>

<p>Faline sighed. “It’s a long time since we’ve
seen each other,” she said. Then she added,
“People grow to be strangers,” but she was already
using her gay bantering tone again. They
remained together.</p>

<p>“I used to walk on this path with my mother
when I was a child,” Bambi said after a
while.</p>

<p>“It leads to the meadow,” said Faline.</p>

<p>“I saw you for the first time on the meadow,”
said Bambi a little solemnly. “Do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Faline replied. “Gobo and me.” She
sighed softly and said, “Poor Gobo....”</p>

<p>Bambi repeated, “Poor Gobo.”</p>

<p>Then they began to talk about old times and
asked each other every minute, “Do you remember?”
Each saw that the other still remembered
everything. And they were both pleased at
that.</p>

<p>“Do you remember how we used to play tag
on the meadow?” Bambi reminisced.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was like this,” said Faline and she was
off like an arrow. At first Bambi hung back,
somewhat surprised, and then he rushed after
her. “Wait! wait!” he cried joyously.</p>

<p>“I can’t wait,” teased Faline, “I’m in too much
of a hurry.” And bounding lightly away, she ran
in a circle through the grass and bushes. At last
Bambi caught up with her and barred the way.
Then they stood quietly side by side. They
laughed contentedly. Suddenly Faline leaped
into the air as though some one had hit her, and
bounded off anew. Bambi rushed after her.
Faline raced around and around, always managing
to elude him.</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“Stop!” Bambi panted. “I want to ask you
something.”</p>

<p>Faline stopped.</p>

<p>“What do you want to ask me?” she inquired
curiously.</p>

<p>Bambi was silent.</p>

<p>“O, so you’re only fooling me,” said Faline,
and started to turn away.</p>

<p>“No,” said Bambi quickly. “Stop! stop! I
wanted ... I wanted to ask you ... do you
love me, Faline?...”</p>

<p>She looked at him more curiously than before,
and a little guardedly. “I don’t know,” she said.</p>

<p>“But you must know,” Bambi insisted. “I know
very well that I love you. I love you terribly,
Faline. Tell me, don’t you love me?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I do,” she answered coyly.</p>

<p>“And will you stay with me?” Bambi demanded
passionately.</p>

<p>“If you ask me nicely,” Faline said happily.</p>

<p>“Please do, Faline, dear, beautiful, beloved Faline,”
cried Bambi beside himself with love.
“Do you hear me? I want you with all my
heart.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll certainly stay with you,” said Faline
gently, and ran away.</p>

<p>In ecstasy, Bambi darted after her again. Faline
fled straight across the meadow, swerved
about and vanished into the thicket. But as Bambi
swerved to follow her there was a fierce rustling
in the bushes and Karus sprang out.</p>

<p>“Halt!” he cried.</p>

<p>Bambi did not hear him. He was too busy with
Faline. “Let me pass,” he said hurriedly, “I
haven’t time for you.”</p>

<p>“Get out,” Karus commanded angrily. “Get
away from here this minute or I’ll shake you until
there’s no breath left in your body. I forbid
you to follow Faline.”</p>

<p>The memory of last summer when he had been
so often and so miserably hunted awakened in
Bambi. Suddenly he became enraged. He did
not say a word, but without waiting any longer
rushed at Karus with his antlers lowered.</p>

<p>His charge was irresistible and, before he knew
what had happened, Karus was lying in the grass.
He was up again quicker than a flash, but was no
sooner on his feet than a new attack made him
stagger.</p>

<p>“Bambi,” he cried. “Bam ...” he tried to cry
again, but a third blow, that glanced off his shoulder,
nearly choked him with pain.</p>

<p>Karus sprang to one side in order to elude
Bambi who came rushing on again. Suddenly he
felt strangely weak. At the same time he realized
with a qualm that this was a life and death
struggle. Cold terror seized him. He turned to
flee from the silent Bambi who came rushing
after him. Karus knew that Bambi was furious
and would kill him without mercy, and
that thought numbed his wits completely. He
fled from the path and, with a final effort,
burst through the bushes. His one hope was of
escape.</p>

<p>All at once Bambi ceased chasing him. Karus
did not even notice this in his terror, and kept
straight on through the bushes as fast as he could
go. Bambi had stopped because he had heard
Faline’s shrill call. He listened as she called
again in distress and fear. Suddenly he faced
about and rushed back.</p>

<p>When he reached the meadow he saw Ronno
pursuing Faline who had fled into the thicket.</p>

<p>“Ronno,” cried Bambi. He did not even realize
that he had called.</p>

<p>Ronno, who could not run very fast because of
his lameness, stood still.</p>

<p>“O, there’s our little Bambi,” he said scornfully,
“do you want something from me?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Bambi quietly but in a voice which
control and overpowering anger had completely
altered. “I want you to let Faline alone and to
leave here immediately.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” sneered Ronno. “What an insolent
gamin you’ve got to be. I wouldn’t have
thought it possible.”</p>

<p>“Ronno,” said Bambi still more softly, “it’s for
your own sake. If you don’t go now you’ll be
glad to run later, but then you’ll never be able to
run again.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” cried Ronno in a rage. “Do you
dare to talk to me like that? It’s because I limp,
I suppose. Most people don’t even notice it. Or
maybe you think I’m afraid of you, too, because
Karus was such a pitiful coward. I give you fair
warning....”</p>

<p>“No, Ronno,” Bambi broke in, “I’ll do all the
warning. Go!” His voice trembled. “I always
liked you, Ronno. I always thought you were very
clever and respected you because you were older
than I am. I tell you once and for all, go. I
haven’t any patience left.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity you have so little patience,” Ronno
said with a sneer, “a great pity for you, my boy.
But be easy, I’ll soon finish you off. You won’t
have long to wait. Maybe you’ve forgotten how
often I used to chase you.”</p>

<p>At the thought of that Bambi had nothing
more to say. Nothing could hold him back. Like
a wild beast he tore at Ronno who met him with
his head lowered. They charged together with a
crash. Ronno stood firm but wondered why
Bambi did not blench back. The sudden charge
had dazed him, for he had not expected that
Bambi would attack him first. Uneasily he felt
Bambi’s giant strength and saw that he must keep
himself well in hand.</p>

<p>He tried to turn a trick as they stood forehead
pressed against forehead. He suddenly shifted
his weight so that Bambi lost his balance and
staggered forward.</p>

<p>Bambi braced with his hind legs and hurled
himself on Ronno with redoubled fury before he
had time to regain his footing. A prong broke
from Ronno’s antlers with a loud snap. Ronno
thought his forehead was shattered. The sparks
danced before his eyes and there was a roaring in
his ears. The next moment a terrific blow tore
open his shoulder. His breath failed him and he
fell to the ground with Bambi standing over him
furiously.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” Ronno groaned.</p>

<p>Bambi charged blindly at him. His eyes
flashed. He seemed to have no thought of mercy.</p>

<p>“Please stop,” whined Ronno pitifully. “Don’t
you know that I’m lame? I was only joking.
Spare me. Can’t you take a joke?”</p>

<p>Bambi let him alone without a word. Ronno
rose wearily. He was bleeding and his legs tottered.
He slunk off in silence.</p>

<p>Bambi started for the thicket to look for Faline,
but she came out of her own accord. She
had been standing at the edge of the woods and
had seen it all.</p>

<p>“That was wonderful,” she said laughingly.
Then she added softly and seriously, “I love you.”</p>

<p>They walked on very happily together.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>One</span> day they went to look for the
little clearing in the depth of the woods where
Bambi had last met the old stag. Bambi told Faline
all about the old stag and grew enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll meet him again,” he said. “I’d
like you to see him.”</p>

<p>“It would be nice,” said Faline boldly. “I’d
really like to chat with him once myself.” But
she wasn’t telling the truth for, though she was
very inquisitive, she was afraid of the old stag.</p>

<p>The twilight was already dusky gray. Sunset
was near.</p>

<p>They walked softly side by side where the
leaves hung quivering on the shrubs and bushes
and permitted a clear view in all directions. Presently
there was a rustling sound near by. They
stopped and looked towards it. Then the old stag
marched slowly and powerfully through the
bushes, into the clearing. In the drab twilight he
seemed like a gigantic gray shadow.</p>

<p>Faline uttered an involuntary cry. Bambi controlled
himself. He was terrified, too, and a cry
stuck in his throat. But Faline’s voice sounded so
helpless that pity seized him and made him want
to comfort her.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he whispered solicitously,
while his voice quavered, “what’s the matter with
you? He isn’t going to hurt us.”</p>

<p>Faline simply shrieked again.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so terribly upset, beloved,” Bambi
pleaded. “It’s ridiculous to be so frightened by
him. After all he’s one of our own family.”</p>

<p>But Faline wouldn’t be comforted. She stood
stock-still, staring at the stag who went along unconcerned.
Then she shrieked and shrieked.</p>

<p>“Pull yourself together,” Bambi begged.
“What will he think of us?”</p>

<p>But Faline was not to be quieted. “He can think
what he likes,” she cried bleating again. “Ah-oh!
Baoh!... It’s terrible to be so big!”</p>

<p>She bleated again, “Baoh! Leave me,” she went
on, “I can’t help it, I have to bleat. Baoh, baoh,
baoh!”</p>

<p>The stag was standing in the little clearing,
looking for tidbits in the grass.</p>

<p>Fresh courage came to Bambi who had one eye
on the hysterical Faline, the other on the placid
stag. With the encouragement he had given Faline
he had conquered his own fears. He began
to reproach himself for the pitiful state he was in
whenever he saw the old stag, a state of mingled
terror and excitement, admiration and submissiveness.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly absurd,” he said with painful
decision. “I’m going straight over to tell him
who I am.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” cried Faline. “Don’t! Baoh! Something
terrible will happen. Baoh!”</p>

<p>“I’m going anyway,” answered Bambi.</p>

<p>The stag who was feasting so calmly, not paying
the slightest attention to the weeping Faline,
seemed altogether too haughty to him. He felt
offended and humiliated. “I’m going,” he said.
“Be quiet. You’ll see, nothing will happen. Wait
for me here.”</p>

<p>He went, but Faline did not wait. She hadn’t
the least desire or courage to do so. She faced
about and ran away crying, for she thought it was
the best thing she could do. Bambi could hear
her going farther and farther away, bleating, “Baoh!
Baoh!”</p>

<p>Bambi would gladly have followed her. But
that was no longer possible. He pulled himself
together and went forward.</p>

<p>Through the branches he saw the stag standing
in the clearing, his head close to the ground.
Bambi felt his heart pounding as he stepped
out.</p>

<p>The stag immediately lifted his head and looked
at him. Then he gazed absently straight ahead
again. The way in which the stag gazed into
space, as though no one else were there, seemed as
haughty to Bambi as the way he had stared at
him.</p>

<hr class="chap">

    <p>The stag immediately lifted his head and looked at him.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Bambi did not know what to do. He had come
with the firm intention of speaking to the stag.
He wanted to say, “Good day, I am Bambi. May
I ask to know your honorable name also?”</p>

<p>Yes, it had all seemed very easy, but now it appeared
that the affair was not so simple. What
good were the best of intentions now? Bambi did
not want to seem ill-bred as he would be if he
went off without saying a word. But he did not
want to seem forward either, and he would be if
he began the conversation.</p>

<p>The stag was wonderfully majestic. It delighted
Bambi and made him feel humble. He
tried in vain to arouse his courage and kept asking
himself, “Why do I let him frighten me? Am
I not just as good as he is?” But it was no use.
Bambi continued to be frightened and felt in his
heart of hearts that he really was not as good as
the old stag. Far from it. He felt wretched and
had to use all his strength to keep himself steady.</p>

<p>The old stag looked at him and thought, “He’s
handsome, he’s really charming, so delicate, so
poised, so elegant in his whole bearing. I must
not stare at him, though. It really isn’t the thing
to do. Besides, it might embarrass him.” So he
stared over Bambi’s head into the empty air again.</p>

<p>“What a haughty look,” thought Bambi. “It’s
unbearable, the opinion such people have of themselves.”</p>

<p>The stag was thinking, “I’d like to talk to him,
he looks so sympathetic. How stupid never to
speak to people we don’t know.” He looked
thoughtfully ahead of him.</p>

<p>“I might as well be air,” said Bambi to himself.
“This fellow acts as though he were the only
thing on the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>“What should I say to him?” the old stag was
wondering. “I’m not used to talking. I’d say
something stupid and make myself ridiculous ... for he’s undoubtedly very clever.”</p>

<p>Bambi pulled himself together and looked
fixedly at the stag. “How splendid he is,” he
thought despairingly.</p>

<p>“Well, some other time, perhaps,” the stag decided
and walked off, dissatisfied but majestic.</p>

<p>Bambi remained filled with bitterness.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> forest sweltered under a scorching
sun. Since it rose it had driven even the tiniest
cloudlet from the sky, and shone all alone in
the wide blue depths that were pallid now with
heat. Over the meadows and the tree-tops the air
quivered in glassy, transparent ripples as it does
over a flame. Not a leaf was moving, not a blade
of grass. The birds were silent and sat hidden
among the shady leaves, never stirring from their
places. All the paths and trails in the thicket were
empty. Not a creature was abroad. The forest
lay as though hurt by the blinding light. The
earth and the trees, the bushes, the beasts
breathed in the intense heat with a kind of sluggish
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Bambi was asleep.</p>

<p>He had made merry with Faline all night. He
had pranced around with her until broad daylight,
and in his bliss had even forgotten to eat.
But he had grown so tired that he did not feel
hungry any more. His eyes fell shut. He lay
down where he happened to be standing in the
middle of the bushes, and fell asleep at once.</p>

<p>The bitter acrid odor that streamed from the
sun-warmed juniper, and the penetrating scent of
spurge laurel, mounted to his head while he slept
and gave him new strength. Suddenly he awoke
in a daze. Had Faline called him? Bambi
looked around. He remembered seeing Faline as
he lay down, standing close beside him near the
white-thorn, nibbling the leaves. He had supposed
she would remain near him, but she was gone.
Apparently she had grown tired of being alone
by now and was calling for him to come and look
for her.</p>

<p>As Bambi listened he wondered how long he
could have slept and how often Faline had called.
He wasn’t sure. Veils of sleep still clouded his
thought.</p>

<p>Then she called again. With a sidewise spring
Bambi turned in the direction the sound came
from. Then he heard it again. And suddenly he
felt perfectly happy. He was wonderfully refreshed,
quieted and strengthened, but racked by
a terrific appetite.</p>

<p>The call came again clearly, thin as a bird’s
twittering, tender and full of longing: “Come,
come!” it said.</p>

<p>Yes, that was her voice. That was Faline.
Bambi rushed away so fast that the dry branches
barely crackled as he burst through the bushes
and the hot green leaves scarcely rustled.</p>

<p>But he had to stop short in the midst of his
course, and swerve to one side, for the old stag
was standing there, barring his path.</p>

<p>Bambi had no time for anything but love. The
old stag was indifferent to him now. He would
meet him again somewhere later on. He had no
time for old stags now, however noble they might
be. He had thoughts for Faline alone. He greeted
the stag hastily and tried to hurry by.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked the old stag
earnestly.</p>

<p>Bambi was somewhat embarrassed and tried to
think of an evasion, but he changed his mind and
answered truthfully “To her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go,” said the old stag.</p>

<p>For a second a single angry spark flared up in
Bambi’s mind. Not go to Faline? How could
the mean old stag ask that? “I’ll simply run off,”
Bambi thought. And he looked quickly at the old
stag. But the deep look that met him in the old
stag’s eyes held him fast. He quivered with impatience
but he did not run away.</p>

<p>“She’s calling me,” he said in explanation. He
said it in a tone which clearly bleated, “Don’t
keep me talking here.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the old stag, “she isn’t calling.”</p>

<p>The call came once again, thin as a bird’s twittering,
“Come!”</p>

<p>“Listen,” Bambi cried excitedly, “there it is
again.”</p>

<p>“I hear it,” said the old stag, nodding.</p>

<p>“Well, good-by,” Bambi flung back hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Stop!” the old stag commanded.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” cried Bambi, beside himself
with impatience. “Let me go. I have no
time. Please, Faline is calling.... You ought
to see that....”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” the old stag said, “that it isn’t
she.”</p>

<p>Bambi was desperate. “But,” he said, “I know
her voice.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” the old stag went on.</p>

<p>Again the call came. Bambi felt the ground
burning under his feet. “Later,” he pleaded, “I’ll
come right back.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the old stag sadly, “you’ll never
come back, never again.”</p>

<p>The call came again. “I must go! I must go!”
cried Bambi who was nearly out of his wits.</p>

<p>“Then,” the old stag declared in a commanding
voice, “we’ll go together.”</p>

<p>“Quickly,” cried Bambi and bounded off.</p>

<p>“No, slowly,” commanded the old stag in a
voice that forced Bambi to obey. “Stay in back
of me. Move one step at a time.”</p>

<p>The old stag began to move forward. Bambi
followed, sighing with impatience.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said the old stag without stopping,
“no matter how often that call comes, don’t stir
from my side. If it’s Faline, you’ll get to hear her
soon enough. But it isn’t Faline. Don’t let yourself
be tempted. Everything depends now on
whether you trust me or not.”</p>

<p>Bambi did not dare to resist, and surrendered
in silence.</p>

<p>The old stag advanced slowly and Bambi followed
him. O how cleverly the old stag moved!
Not a sound came from under his hoofs. Not a
leaf was disturbed. Not a twig snapped. And
yet they were gliding through thick bushes, slinking
through the ancient tangled thicket. Bambi
was amazed and had to admire him in spite of his
impatience. He had never dreamed that anybody
could move like that.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus15.jpg" alt="" id="illus15">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>The old stag advanced slowly and Bambi followed him.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>The call came again and again. The old stag
stood still, listening and nodding his head. Bambi
stood beside him, shaken with desire, and suffering
from restraint. He could not understand it at
all.</p>

<p>Several times the old stag stopped, although
no call had come, and lifted his head, listening
and nodding. Bambi heard nothing. The old stag
turned away from the direction of the call and
made a detour. Bambi raged inwardly because of it.</p>

<p>The call came again and again. At last they
drew nearer to it, then still nearer. At last they
were quite near.</p>

<p>The old stag whispered, “No matter what
you see, don’t move, do you hear? Watch everything
I do and act just as I do, cautiously. And
don’t lose your head.”</p>

<p>They went a few steps farther and suddenly
that sharp, arresting scent that Bambi knew so
well struck them full in the face. He swallowed
so much of it that he nearly cried out. He stood
as though rooted to the ground. For a moment
his heart seemed pounding in his throat. The old
stag stood calmly beside him and motioned with
his eyes.</p>

<p>He was standing there.</p>

<p>He was standing quite close to them leaning
against the trunk of an oak, hidden by hazel
bushes. He was calling softly, “Come, come!”</p>

<p>Bambi was completely bewildered. He was so
terrified that he began to understand only by degrees
that it was He who was imitating Faline’s
voice. It was He who was calling, “Come, come!”</p>

<p>Cold terror shot through Bambi’s body. The
idea of flight gripped him and tugged at his
heart.</p>

<p>“Be still,” whispered the old stag quickly and
commandingly as if he meant to forestall any
outbreak of fear. Bambi controlled himself with
an effort.</p>

<p>The old stag looked at him a little scornfully
at first, it seemed to Bambi. He noticed it in spite
of the state he was in. But the stag changed at
once to a serious and kindly look.</p>

<p>Bambi peered out with blinking eyes to where
He was standing, and felt as if he could not bear
His horrible presence much longer.</p>

<p>As if he had read this thought, the old stag whispered
to him, “Let’s go back,” and turned about.</p>

<p>They glided away cautiously. The old stag
moved with a marvelous zigzag course whose
purpose Bambi did not understand. Again he followed
with painfully controlled impatience. The
longing for Faline had harassed him on the way
over; now the impulse to flee was beating through
his veins.</p>

<p>But the old stag walked on slowly, stopping
and listening. He would begin a new zigzag,
then stop again, going very slowly ahead.</p>

<p>By this time they were far from the danger
spot. “If he stops again,” thought Bambi, “it
ought to be all right to speak to him by now, and
I’ll thank him.”</p>

<p>But at that moment the old stag vanished under
his very eyes into a thick tangle of dogwood
shrubs. Not a leaf stirred, not a twig snapped as
the stag slipped away.</p>

<p>Bambi followed and tried to get through as
noiselessly, and to avoid every sound with as much
skill. But he was not so lucky. The leaves swished
gently, the boughs bent against his flanks and
sprang up again with a loud twang; dry branches
broke against his chest with sharp piercing snaps.</p>

<p>“He saved my life,” Bambi kept thinking.
“What can I say to him?”</p>

<p>But the old stag was nowhere to be seen. Bambi
came out of the bushes. Around him was a sea
of yellow, flowering goldenrod. He raised his
head and looked around. Not a leaf was moving
as far as he could see. He was all alone.</p>

<p>Freed from all control, the impulse to flee
suddenly carried him away. The goldenrods
parted with a loud swish beneath his bounding
hoofs as though under the stroke of a scythe.</p>

<p>After wandering about for a long time he
found Faline. He was breathless, tired and happy
and deeply stirred.</p>

<p>“Please, beloved,” he said, “please don’t ever
call me again. We’ll search until we find each
other, but please don’t ever call me ... for I
can’t resist your voice.”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>A few</span> days later they were walking
carefree together through an oak thicket on the
far side of the meadow. They had to cross the
meadow in order to reach their old trail where
the tall oak stood.</p>

<p>As the bushes grew thinner around them they
stopped and peered out. Something red was moving
near the oak. Both of them looked at it.</p>

<p>“Who can it be?” whispered Bambi.</p>

<p>“Probably Ronno or Karus,” said Faline.</p>

<p>Bambi doubted it. “They don’t dare come near
me any more,” Bambi said, peering sharply
ahead. “No,” he decided, “that’s not Karus or
Ronno. It’s a stranger.”</p>

<p>Faline agreed, surprised, and very curious.
“Yes,” she said, “it’s a stranger. I see it, too,
now. How curious!”</p>

<p>They watched him.</p>

<p>“How carelessly he acts,” exclaimed Faline.</p>

<p>“Stupid,” said Bambi, “really stupid. He acts
like a little child, as if there were no danger.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go over,” Faline proposed. Her curiosity
was getting the better of her.</p>

<p>“All right,” Bambi answered. “Let’s go, I
want to have a better look at the fellow.”</p>

<p>They took a few steps and then Faline stopped.
“Suppose he wants to fight you,” she said. “He’s
strong.”</p>

<p>“Bah,” said Bambi holding his head cocked and
putting on a disdainful air, “look at the little
antlers he has. Should I be afraid of that? The
fellow is fat and sleek enough, but is he strong?
I don’t think so. Come along.”</p>

<p>They went on.</p>

<p>The stranger was busy nibbling meadow grass
and did not notice them until they were a good
way across the meadow. Then he ran forward to
meet them. He gave joyful playful skips that
made a curiously childish impression. Bambi and
Faline stopped, surprised, and waited for him.
When he was a few steps off he stood still likewise.</p>

<p>After a while he asked, “Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>Bambi had lowered his head prepared for
battle. “Do you know us?” he retorted.</p>

<p>The stranger interrupted him. “Bambi,” he
cried reproachfully, yet confidently.</p>

<p>Bambi was startled to hear his name spoken.
The sound of that voice stirred an old memory in his
heart. But Faline had rushed towards the stranger.</p>

<p>“Gobo,” she cried and became speechless. She
stood there silent without moving. She couldn’t
breathe.</p>

<p>“Faline,” said Gobo softly, “Faline, sister, you
knew me anyway.” He went to her and kissed
her mouth. The tears were running down his
cheeks. Faline was crying too, and couldn’t speak.</p>

    <p>“Faline, sister, you knew me anyway.” Gobo went to her and kissed her mouth.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“Well, Gobo,” Bambi began. His voice trembled
and he felt very bewildered. He was deeply
moved and very much surprised. “Well, so you’re
not dead,” he said.</p>

<p>Gobo burst out laughing. “You see that I’m
not dead,” he said; “at least I think you can see
that I’m not.”</p>

<p>“But what happened that time in the snow?”
Bambi persisted.</p>

<p>“O then?” Gobo said thoughtfully. “He rescued
me then.”</p>

<p>“And where have you been all this time?”
asked Faline in astonishment.</p>

<p>“With Him,” Gobo replied, “I’ve been with
Him all the time.”</p>

<p>He grew silent and looked at Faline and at
Bambi. Their helpless astonishment delighted
him. Then he added, “Yes, my dears, I’ve seen
a lot more than all of you put together in your
old forest.” He sounded somewhat boastful, but
they paid no attention to it. They were still too
much absorbed in their great surprise.</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” cried Faline beside herself
with joy.</p>

<p>“O,” said Gobo with satisfaction, “I could talk
all day about it and never reach the end.”</p>

<p>“Well then, go ahead and talk,” Bambi urged.</p>

<p>Gobo turned to Faline and grew serious. “Is
mother still alive?” he asked timidly and softly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Faline gladly. “She’s alive but I
haven’t seen her for a long while.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see her right away,” said Gobo
with decision. “Are you coming too?”</p>

<p>They all went.</p>

<p>They did not speak another word the whole
way. Bambi and Faline felt Gobo’s impatient
longing to see his mother, so both of them kept
silent. Gobo walked ahead hurriedly and did
not speak. They let him do as he liked.</p>

<p>Only sometimes when he hurried blindly over
a cross-trail or when, in a sudden burst of speed,
he took the wrong turning, they called gently to
him. “This way,” Bambi would whisper, or Faline
would say, “No, no, we go this way now.”</p>

<p>A number of times they had to cross wide
clearings. They noticed that Gobo never stopped
at the edge of the thicket, never peered around
for a moment when he walked into the open, but
simply ran out without any precaution. Bambi
and Faline exchanged astonished glances whenever
this happened, but they never said a word
and followed Gobo with some hesitation. They
had to wander around sometimes and search high
and low.</p>

<p>Gobo recollected his childhood paths at once.
He was delighted with himself, never realizing
that Bambi and Faline were leading him. He
looked around at them and called, “How do you
like the way I can still find my way around?”
They did not say anything, but they exchanged
glances again.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards they came to a small leafy
hollow. “Look,” cried Faline and glided in. Gobo
followed her and stopped. It was the glade in
which they were both born and had lived with
their mother as little children. Gobo and Faline
looked into each other’s eyes. They did not say
a word. But Faline kissed her brother gently on
the mouth. Then they hurried on.</p>

<p>They walked to and fro for a good hour.
The sun shone brighter and brighter through the
branches and the forest grew stiller and stiller.
It was the time for lying down and resting. But
Gobo didn’t feel tired. He walked swiftly ahead,
breathing deeply with impatience and excitement,
and gazed aimlessly about him. He shrank
together whenever a weasel slunk through the
bushes at his feet. He nearly stepped on the
pheasants, and when they scolded him, flying up
with a loud flapping of wings, he was terribly
frightened. Bambi marveled at the strange, blind
way Gobo moved around.</p>

<p>Presently Gobo stopped and turned to them
both. “She isn’t anywhere here,” he cried in
despair.</p>

<p>Faline soothed him. “We’ll soon find her,” she
said, deeply moved, “soon, Gobo.” She looked at
him. He still had that dejected look she knew so
well.</p>

<p>“Shall we call her?” she asked smiling. “Shall
we call her the way we used to when we were
children?”</p>

<p>Bambi went away a few steps. Then he saw
Aunt Ena. She had already settled herself to rest
and was lying quietly in a nearby hazel bush.</p>

<p>“At last,” he said to himself. At the same
moment Gobo and Faline came up. All three of
them stood together and looked at Ena. She had
raised her head quietly and looked sleepily back
at them.</p>

<p>Gobo took a few hesitating steps and cried
softly, “Mother.”</p>

<p>She was on her feet in a flash and stood as
though transfixed. Gobo sprang to her quickly.
“Mother,” he began again. He tried to speak
but couldn’t utter a word.</p>

<p>His mother looked deep into his eyes. Her
rigid body began to move. Wave after wave of
trembling broke over her shoulders and down her
back.</p>

<p>She did not ask any questions. She did not want
any explanation or history. She kissed Gobo
slowly on the mouth. She kissed his cheeks and
his neck. She bathed him tirelessly in her kisses,
as she had when he was born.</p>

<p>Bambi and Faline had gone away.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>They</span> were all standing around in
the middle of the thicket in a little clearing. Gobo
was talking to them.</p>

<p>Even Friend Hare was there. Full of astonishment,
he would lift one spoonlike ear, listen attentively,
and let it fall back, only to lift it again
at once.</p>

<p>The magpie was perched on the lowest branch
of a young beech and listened in amazement. The
jay was sitting restlessly on an ash opposite and
screamed every once in a while in wonder.</p>

<p>A few friendly pheasants had brought their
wives and children and were stretching their
necks in surprise as they listened. At times they
would jerk them in again, turning their heads this
way and that in speechless wonder.</p>

<p>The squirrel had scurried up and was gesturing,
wild with excitement. At times he would
slide to the ground, at times he would run up
some tree or other. Or he would balance with
his tail erect and display his white chest. Every
now and again he tried to interrupt Gobo and say
something, but he was always told sternly to keep
quiet.</p>

<p>Gobo told how he had lain helpless in the snow
waiting to die.</p>

<p>“The dogs found me,” he said. “Dogs are
terrible. They are certainly the most terrible creatures
in the world. Their jaws drip blood and
their bark is pitiless and full of anger.” He
looked all around the circle and continued, “Well,
since then I’ve played with them just as I would
with one of you.” He was very proud. “I don’t
need to be afraid of them any more, I’m good
friends with them now. Nevertheless, when they
begin to grow angry, I have a roaring in my ears
and my heart stops beating. But they don’t really
mean any harm by it and, as I said, I’m a good
friend of theirs. But their bark is terribly
loud.”</p>

    <p>“The dogs found me.”</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“Go on,” Faline urged.</p>

<p>Gobo looked at her. “Well,” he said, “they
would have torn me to pieces, but He came.”</p>

<p>Gobo paused. The others hardly breathed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gobo, “He came. He called off the
dogs and they quieted down at once. He called
them again and they crouched motionless at
His feet. Then He picked me up. I screamed
but He petted me. He held me in His arms.
He didn’t hurt me. And then He carried me
away.”</p>

<p>Faline interrupted him. “What does ‘carry’
mean?” she asked.</p>

<p>Gobo began to explain it in great detail.</p>

<p>“It’s very simple,” Bambi broke in, “look at
what the squirrel does when he takes a nut and
carries it off.”</p>

<p>The squirrel tried to speak again. “A cousin
of mine ...” he began eagerly. But the others
cried out at once, “Be still, be still, let Gobo go
on.”</p>

<p>The squirrel had to keep quiet. He was desperate
and, pressing his forepaws against his white
chest, he tried to begin a conversation with the
magpie. “As I was saying, a cousin of mine ...”
he began. But the magpie simply turned her
back on him.</p>

<p>Gobo told of wonders. “Outside it will be cold
and the storm is howling. But inside there’s not
a breath of wind and it’s as warm as in summertime,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Akh!” screamed the jay.</p>

<p>“The rain may be pouring outside so that
everything is flooded. But not a drop of it gets
inside and you keep dry.”</p>

<p>The pheasants craned their necks and twisted
their heads.</p>

<p>“Everything outside may be snowed under, but
inside I was warm,” said Gobo; “I was even hot.
They gave me hay to eat and chestnuts, potatoes
and turnips, whatever I wanted.”</p>

<p>“Hay?” they all cried at once, amazed, incredulous
and excited.</p>

<p>“Sweet, new-mown hay,” Gobo repeated
calmly, and gazed triumphantly around.</p>

<p>The squirrel’s voice cut in, “A cousin of
mine ...”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” cried the others.</p>

<p>“Where does He get hay and all the rest of
the things in winter?” asked Faline eagerly.</p>

<p>“He grows them,” Gobo answered, “He grows
what He wants and keeps what He wants.”</p>

<p>Faline went on questioning him: “Weren’t you
ever afraid, Gobo, when you were with Him?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Gobo smiled a very superior smile. “No, dear
Faline,” he said, “not any more. I got to know
that He wouldn’t hurt me. Why should I have
been afraid? You all think He’s wicked. But He
isn’t wicked. If He loves anybody or if anybody
serves Him, He’s good to him. Wonderfully good!
Nobody in the world can be as kind as He can.”</p>

<p>While Gobo was talking that way the old stag
suddenly stepped noiselessly from the bushes.</p>

<p>Gobo didn’t notice him and went on talking.
But the others saw the old stag and held their
breath in awe.</p>

<p>The old stag stood motionless, watching Gobo
with deep and serious eyes.</p>

<p>Gobo said, “Not only He, but all His children
loved me. His wife and all of them used to pet
me and play with me.” He broke off suddenly.
He had seen the old stag.</p>

<p>A silence followed.</p>

<p>Then the old stag asked in his quiet commanding
voice, “What kind of a band is that you have
on your neck?”</p>

<p>Everybody looked at it and noticed for the first
time the dark strip of braided horsehair around
Gobo’s neck.</p>

<p>Gobo answered uneasily, “That? Why that’s
part of the halter I wore. It’s His halter and it’s
the greatest honor to wear His halter, it’s ...”
He grew confused and stammered.</p>

<p>Everyone was silent. The old stag looked at
Gobo for a long time, piercingly and sadly.</p>

<p>“You poor thing!” he said softly at last, and
turned and was gone.</p>

<p>In the astonished silence that followed, the
squirrel began to chatter again. “As I was saying,
a cousin of mine stayed with Him, too. He caught
him and shut him up, oh, for the longest while,
till one day my father ...”</p>

<p>But nobody was listening to the squirrel. They
were all walking away.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>One</span> day Marena appeared again.
She was almost full grown the winter that
Gobo disappeared, but she had hardly ever been
seen since, for she lived alone, going her own
ways.</p>

<p>She had stayed slender and looked quite young.
But she was quiet and serious and gentler than
any of the others. She had heard from the squirrel
and the jay, the magpie and the thrushes and
pheasants that Gobo had returned from his wonderful
adventures. So she came back to see him.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus18.jpg" alt="" id="illus18">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>Marena was quiet and serious and gentler than any of the others.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Gobo’s mother was very proud and happy over
her visit. Gobo’s mother had grown rather proud
of her good fortune. She was delighted to hear
the whole forest talking about her son. She
basked in his glory and wanted everybody to
know that her Gobo was the cleverest, ablest and
best deer living.</p>

<p>“What do you think of him, Marena?” she
exclaimed. “What do you think of our Gobo?”
She didn’t wait for an answer but went on, “Do
you remember how old Nettla said he wasn’t
worth much because he shivered a little in the
cold? Do you remember how she prophesied
that he’d be nothing but a care to me?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Marena answered, “you’ve had plenty
of worry over Gobo.”</p>

<p>“That’s all over with now,” his mother exclaimed.
She wondered how people could still
remember such things. “O, I’m sorry for poor
old Nettla. What a pity that she couldn’t live to
see what my Gobo’s become!”</p>

<p>“Yes, poor old Nettla,” said Marena softly,
“it’s too bad about her.”</p>

<p>Gobo liked to hear his mother praise him that
way. It pleased him. He stood around and
basked as happily in her praises as in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Even the old Prince came to see Gobo,” his
mother told Marena. She whispered it as though
it were something solemn and mysterious. “He
never let anyone so much as get a glimpse of him
before, but he came on account of Gobo.”</p>

<p>“Why did he call me a poor thing?” Gobo
broke in in a discontented tone. “I’d like to know
what he meant by that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think about it,” his mother said to comfort
him, “he’s old and queer.”</p>

<p>But at last Gobo meant to ease his mind. “All
day long it keeps running through my head,” he
said. “Poor thing! I’m not a poor thing. I’m
very lucky. I’ve seen more and been through
more than all the rest of you put together. I’ve
seen more of the world and I know more about
life than anyone in the forest. What do you
think, Marena?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “no one can deny that.”</p>

<p>From then on Marena and Gobo were always
together.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Bambi</span> went to look for the old stag.
He roamed around all night long. He wandered
till the sun rose and dawn found him on unbeaten
trails without Faline.</p>

<p>He was still drawn to Faline at times. At times
he loved her just as much as ever. Then he liked to
roam about with her, to listen to her chatter, to
browse with her on the meadow or at the edge of the
thicket. But she no longer satisfied him completely.</p>

<p>Before, when he was with Faline, he hardly
ever remembered his meetings with the old stag,
and when he did it was only casually. Now he
was looking for him and felt an inexplicable desire
driving him to find him. He only thought of
Faline between whiles. He could always be with
her if he wanted to. He did not much care to
stay with the others. Gobo or Aunt Ena he
avoided when he could.</p>

<p>The words the old stag had let fall about Gobo
kept ringing in Bambi’s ears. They made a peculiarly
deep impression on him. Gobo had affected
him strangely from the very first day of his return.
Bambi didn’t know why, but there was
something painful to him in Gobo’s bearing.
Bambi was ashamed of Gobo without knowing
why. And he was afraid for him, again without
knowing why. Whenever he was together with
this harmless, vain, self-conscious and self-satisfied
Gobo, the words kept running through his head,
“Poor thing!” He couldn’t get rid of them.</p>

<p>But one dark night when Bambi had again delighted
the screech-owl by assuring him how
badly he was frightened, it suddenly occurred to
him to ask, “Do you happen to know where the
old stag is now?”</p>

<p>The screech-owl answered in his cooing voice
that he didn’t have the least idea in the world.
But Bambi perceived that he simply didn’t want
to tell.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I don’t believe you, you’re
too clever. You know everything that’s happening
in the forest. You certainly must know where
the old stag is hiding.”</p>

<p>The screech-owl, who was all fluffed up,
smoothed his feathers against his body and made
himself small. “Of course I know,” he cooed
still more softly, “but I oughtn’t to tell you, I
really oughtn’t.”</p>

<p>Bambi began to plead. “I won’t give you
away,” he said. “How could I, when I respect
you so much?”</p>

<p>The owl became a lovely, soft gray-brown ball
again and rolled his big cunning eyes a little as
he always did when he felt in a good humor. “So
you really do respect me,” he asked, “and why,
pray?”</p>

<p>Bambi did not hesitate. “Because you’re so
wise,” he said sincerely, “and so good-natured
and friendly, besides. And because you’re so
clever at frightening people. It’s so very clever
to frighten people, so very, very clever. I wish I
could do it, it would be a great help to me.”</p>

<p>The screech-owl had sunk his bill into his
downy breast and was happy.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I know that the old stag
would be glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” cried Bambi while
his heart began to beat faster for joy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure of it,” the owl answered. “He’d
be glad to see you, and I think I can venture to
tell you where he is now.”</p>

<p>He laid his feathers close to his body and suddenly
grew thin again.</p>

<p>“Do you know the deep ditch where the willows
stand?”</p>

<p>Bambi nodded yes.</p>

<p>“Do you know the young oak thicket on the
farther side?”</p>

<p>“No,” Bambi confessed, “I’ve never been on
the farther side.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen carefully then,” the owl whispered.
“There’s an oak thicket on the far side.
Go through that. Then there are bushes, hazel
and silver poplar, thorn and shadbush. In the
midst of them is an old uprooted beech. You’ll
have to hunt for it. It’s not so easy to see it from
your height as it is from the air. You’ll find
him under the trunk. But don’t tell him I told
you.”</p>

<p>“Under the trunk?” said Bambi.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the screech-owl laughed, “there’s a hollow
in the ground there. The trunk lies right
across it. And he sleeps under the trunk.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Bambi sincerely. “I don’t
know if I can find it, but I’m very grateful anyhow.”
He ran quickly away.</p>

<p>The screech-owl flew noiselessly after him and
began to hoot right beside him. “Oi, oi!”
Bambi shrank together.</p>

<p>“Did I frighten you?” asked the owl.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption">
    <p>“Did I frighten you?” asked the owl.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“Yes,” he stammered, and that time he told
the truth.</p>

<p>The owl cooed with satisfaction and said, “I
only wanted to remind you again. Don’t tell him
I told you.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Bambi assured him and ran
on.</p>

<p>When Bambi reached the ditch the old stag
rose before him out of the pitch black night so
noiselessly and suddenly that Bambi drew back in
terror.</p>

<p>“I’m no longer where you were going to look
for me,” said the stag.</p>

<p>Bambi was silent.</p>

<p>“What is it you want?” asked the stag.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Bambi stammered, “nothing, excuse
me, nothing at all.”</p>

<p>After a while the old stag spoke, and his voice
sounded gentle. “This isn’t the first time you’ve
been looking for me,” he said.</p>

<p>He waited. Bambi did not answer. The old
stag went on, “Yesterday you passed close by me
twice, and again this morning, very close.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Bambi gathering courage, “why
did you say that about Gobo?”</p>

<p>“Do you think that I was wrong?”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Bambi sorrowfully, “no, I feel
that you were right.”</p>

<p>The old stag gave a barely perceptible nod
and his eyes rested on Bambi more kindly than
ever before.</p>

<p>“But why?” Bambi said, “I don’t understand
it.”</p>

<p>“It’s enough that you feel it. You will understand
it later,” the old stag said. “Good-by.”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Everybody</span> soon saw that Gobo had
habits which seemed strange and suspicious to the
rest of them. He slept at night when the others
were awake. But in the daytime, when the rest
of them were looking for places to sleep in, he
was wide awake and went walking. When he felt
like it he would even go out of the thicket without
any hesitation and stand with perfect peace of
mind in the bright sunshine on the meadow.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Bambi found it impossible to keep silent any
longer. “Don’t you ever think of the danger?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Gobo said simply, “there isn’t any for me.”</p>

<p>“You forget, my dear Bambi,” Gobo’s mother
broke in, “you forget that He’s a friend of Gobo’s.
Gobo can take chances that the rest of you cannot
take.” She was very proud.</p>

<p>Bambi did not say anything more.</p>

<p>One day Gobo said to him, “You know, it seems
strange to me to eat when and where I like.”</p>

<p>Bambi did not understand. “Why is it strange,
we all do it,” he said.</p>

<p>“O, you do,” said Gobo superiorly, “but I’m
a little different. I’m accustomed to having my
food brought to me or to being called when it’s
ready.”</p>

<p>Bambi stared pityingly at Gobo. He looked at
Faline and Marena and Aunt Ena. But they
were all smiling and admiring Gobo.</p>

<p>“I think it will be hard for you to get accustomed
to the winter, Gobo,” Faline began, “we
don’t have hay or turnips or potatoes in the winter
time.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” answered Gobo reflectively, “I
hadn’t thought about that yet. I can’t even imagine
how it would feel. It must be dreadful.”</p>

<p>Bambi said quietly, “It isn’t dreadful. It’s only
hard.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Gobo declared grandly, “if it gets too
hard for me I’ll simply go back to Him. Why
should I go hungry? There’s no need for that.”</p>

<p>Bambi turned away without a word and walked
off.</p>

<p>When Gobo was alone again with Marena he
began to talk about Bambi. “He doesn’t understand
me,” he said. “Poor old Bambi thinks I’m
still the silly little Gobo that I once was. He can
never get used to the fact that I’ve become something
unusual. Danger!... What does he
mean by danger? He means well enough by me,
but danger is something for him and the likes of
him, not for me.”</p>

<p>Marena agreed with him. She loved him and
Gobo loved her and they were both very happy.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said to her, “nobody understands
me the way you do. But anyhow I can’t complain.
I’m respected and honored by everybody.
But you understand me best of all. When I tell
the others how good He is, they listen and they
don’t think I’m lying, but they stick to their opinion
that He’s dreadful.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always believed in Him,” said Marena
dreamily.</p>

<p>“Really?” Gobo replied airily.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the day when they left you
lying in the snow?” Marena went on. “I said
that day that sometime He’d come to the forest
to play with us.”</p>

<p>“No,” Gobo replied yawning, “I don’t remember
that.”</p>

<p>A few weeks passed, and one morning Bambi
and Faline, Gobo and Marena were standing together
again in the old familiar hazel thicket.
Bambi and Faline were just returning from their
wanderings, intending to look for their hiding
place when they met Gobo and Marena. Gobo
was about to go out on the meadow.</p>

<p>“Stay with us instead,” said Bambi, “the sun
will soon be rising and then nobody will go out
in the open.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Gobo, scornfully, “if nobody
else will go, I will.”</p>

<p>He went on, Marena following him.</p>

<p>Bambi and Faline had stopped. “Come along,”
said Bambi angrily to Faline, “come along. Let
him do what he pleases.”</p>

<p>They were going on, but suddenly the jay
screamed loudly from the far side of the meadow.
With a bound Bambi had turned and was running
after Gobo. Right by the oak he caught up
with him and Marena.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” he cried to him.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Gobo puzzled.</p>

<p>Again the jay screamed on the far side of the
meadow.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” Bambi repeated.</p>

<p>“No,” said Gobo calmly.</p>

<p>“That means danger,” Bambi persisted.</p>

<p>A magpie began to chatter loudly and, immediately
after her, another and then a third. Then
the jay screamed again and far overhead the
crows gave warning.</p>

<p>Faline began to plead. “Don’t go out there,
Gobo! It’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>Even Marena begged, “Stay here. Stay here
to-day, beloved one. It’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>Gobo stood there, smiling in his superior way.
“Dangerous! dangerous! What has that to do
with me?” he asked.</p>

<p>His pressing need gave Bambi an idea. “At
least let Marena go first,” he said, “so we can
find out....”</p>

<p>He hadn’t finished before Marena had slipped
out.</p>

<p>All three stood and looked at her, Bambi and
Faline breathlessly, Gobo with obvious patience,
as if to let the others enjoy their foolish whims.</p>

<p>They saw how Marena walked across the
meadow step by step, with hesitant feet, her head
up. She peered and snuffed in all directions.
Suddenly she turned like a flash with one high
bound and, as though a cyclone had struck her,
rushed back into the thicket.</p>

<p>“It’s He, He,” she whispered, her voice choking
with terror. She was trembling in every limb.
“I, I saw Him,” she stammered, “it’s He. He’s
standing over by the alders.”</p>

<p>“Come,” cried Bambi, “come quickly.”</p>

<p>“Come,” Faline pleaded. And Marena who
could hardly speak whispered, “Please come now,
Gobo, please.”</p>

<p>But Gobo remained unmoved. “Run as much
as you like,” he said, “I won’t stop you. If He’s
there I want to talk with Him.”</p>

<p>Gobo could not be dissuaded.</p>

<p>They stood and watched how he went out. They
stayed there, moved by his great confidence, while at
the same time a terrible fear for him gripped them.</p>

<p>Gobo was standing boldly on the meadow
looking around for the alders. Then he seemed
to see them and to have discovered Him. Then
the thunder crashed.</p>

<p>Gobo leaped into the air at the report. He suddenly
turned around and fled back to the thicket,
staggering as he came.</p>

<p>They still stood there, petrified with terror,
while he came on. They heard him gasping for
breath. And as he did not stop but bounded
wildly forward, they turned and surrounded him
and all took flight.</p>

<p>But poor Gobo dropped to the ground.
Marena stopped close to him, Bambi and Faline
a little farther off, ready to flee.</p>

<p>Gobo lay with his bloody entrails oozing from
his torn flank. He lifted his head with a feeble
twisting motion.</p>

<p>“Marena,” he said with an effort, “Marena....” He did not recognize her. His voice failed.</p>

<p>There was a loud careless rustling in the
bushes by the meadow. Marena bent her head towards
Gobo. “He’s coming,” she whispered frantically,
“Gobo, He’s coming! Can’t you get up
and come with me?”</p>

<p>Gobo lifted his head again feebly with a writhing
motion, beat convulsively with his hoofs and
then lay still.</p>

<p>With a crackling, snapping and rustling He
parted the bushes and stepped out.</p>

<p>Marena saw Him from quite near. She slunk
slowly back, disappearing through the nearest
bushes, and hastened to Bambi and Faline.</p>

<p>She looked back once again and saw how He
was bending over and seizing the wounded deer.</p>

<p>Then they heard Gobo’s wailing death shriek.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Bambi</span> was alone. He walked beside
the water that ran swiftly among the reeds and
swamp-willows.</p>

<p>He went there more and more often now that
he was staying by himself. There were few trails
there, and he hardly ever met any of his friends.
That was just what he wanted. For his thoughts
had grown serious and his heart heavy. He did
not know what was happening within him. He
did not even think about it. He merely recalled
things aimlessly, and his whole life seemed to
have become darker.</p>

<p>He used to stand for hours on the bank. The
current, that flowed round a gentle bend there,
occupied his entire thought. The cool air from
the ripples brought him strange, refreshing, acrid
smells that aroused forgetfulness and a sense of
trust in him.</p>

<p>Bambi would stand and watch the ducks paddling
companionably together. They talked endlessly
to one another in a friendly, serious, capable
way.</p>

<hr class="chap">

    <p>The ducks talked endlessly to one another in a friendly, serious, capable way.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>There were a couple of mother ducks, each
with a flock of young ones around her. They were
constantly teaching their young ones things. And
the little ones were always learning them. Sometimes
one or the other of the mothers would give
a warning. Then the young ducks would dash
off in all directions. They would scatter and glide
away perfectly noiselessly. Bambi saw how the
smallest ones, who could not fly yet, would
paddle among the thick rushes without moving a
stem that might betray them by swaying. He
would see the small dark bodies creep here and
there among the reeds. Then he could see nothing
more.</p>

<p>Later one of the mothers would give a short
call and in a flash they would all flock around
her again. In an instant they would reassemble
their flotilla and go on cruising quietly about as
before. Bambi marveled anew at it each time.
It was a constant source of wonder to him.</p>

<p>After one such alarm, Bambi asked one of the
mothers, “What was it? I was looking closely
and I didn’t see anything.”</p>

<p>“It was nothing at all,” answered the duck.</p>

<p>Another time one of the children gave the signal,
turning like a flash and staring through the
reeds. Presently he came out on the bank where
Bambi was standing.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t anything,” the young one replied,
shaking its tail feathers in a grown-up way
and carefully putting the tips of its wings in
place. Then it paddled through the water again.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Bambi had faith in the ducks. He
came to the conclusion that they were more watchful
than he, that they heard and saw things more
quickly. When he stood watching them, that
ceaseless tension that he felt within himself at
other times relaxed a little.</p>

<p>He liked to talk with the ducks, too. They
didn’t talk the nonsense that he so often heard
from the others. They talked about the broad
skies and the wind and about distant fields where
they feasted on choice tidbits.</p>

<p>From time to time Bambi saw something that
looked like a fiery streak in the air beside the
brook. “Srrrri!” the humming bird would cry
softly darting past like a tiny whirring speck.
There was a gleam of green, a glow of red, as
he flashed by and was gone. Bambi was thrilled
and wanted to see the bright stranger near to.
He called to him.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother calling him,” the sedge-hen said
to Bambi from among the reed clumps, “don’t
bother calling. He’ll never answer you.”</p>

<p>“Where are you?” asked Bambi peering among
the reeds.</p>

<p>But the sedge-hen only laughed loudly from
an entirely different place, “Here I am. That
cranky creature you just called to won’t talk to
anyone. It’s useless to call him.”</p>

<p>“He’s so handsome,” said Bambi.</p>

<p>“But bad,” the sedge-hen retorted from still
another place.</p>

<p>“What makes you think him bad?” Bambi inquired.</p>

<p>The sedge-hen answered from an altogether
different place, “He doesn’t care for anything
or anybody. Let anything happen that
wants to, he won’t speak to anybody and never
thanked anybody for speaking to him. He
never gives anybody warning when there’s danger.
He’s never said a word to a living soul.”</p>

<p>“The poor ...” said Bambi.</p>

<p>The sedge-hen went on talking, and her cheery,
piping voice sounded from the far side again.
“He probably thinks that people are jealous of
his silly markings and doesn’t want them to get
too good a look at him.”</p>

<p>“Certain other people don’t let you get a good
look at them either,” said Bambi.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the sedge-hen was standing in
front of him. “There’s nothing to look at in my
case,” she said simply. Small and gleaming with
water, she stood there in her sleek feathers, her
trim figure restless, animated and satisfied. In a
flash she was gone again.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand how people can stand so
long in one spot,” she called from the water. And
added from the far side, “It’s tiresome and dangerous
to stay so long in one spot.” Then from the other
side she cried gayly once or twice. “You have to
keep moving,” she cried happily, “you’ve got to
keep moving if you want to keep whole and hearty.”</p>

<p>A soft rustling in the grass startled Bambi.
He looked around. There was a reddish flash
among the bushes. It disappeared in the reeds.
At the same time a sharp warm smell reached his
nostrils. The fox had slunk by.</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to cry out and stamp on the
ground as a warning. But the sedges rustled as
the fox parted them in quick leaps. The water
splashed and a duck screamed desperately. Bambi
heard her wings flapping and saw her white body
flash through the leaves. He saw how her wings beat
the fox’s face with sharp blows. Then it grew still.</p>

<p>At the same moment the fox came out of the
bushes holding the duck in his jaws. Her neck
hung down limply, her wings were still moving,
but the fox paid no attention to that. He looked
sidewise at Bambi with sneering eyes and crept
slowly into the thicket.</p>

<p>Bambi stood motionless.</p>

<p>A few of the old ducks had flown up with a
rush of wings and were flying around in helpless
fright. The sedge-hen was crying warnings from
all directions. The tit-mice chirped excitedly in
the bushes. And the young orphaned ducks
splashed about the sedge, crying with soft voices.</p>

<p>The hummingbird flew along the bank.</p>

<p>“Please tell us,” the young ducks cried, “please
tell us, have you seen our mother?”</p>

<p>“Srrri,” cried the hummingbird shrilly, and
flew past sparkling, “what has she got to do with
me?”</p>

<p>Bambi turned and went away. He wandered
through a whole sea of goldenrod, passed through
a grove of young beeches, crossed through old
hazel thickets until he reached the edge of the
deep ditch. He roamed around it, hoping to meet
the old stag. He had not seen him for a long
while, not since Gobo’s death.</p>

<p>Then he caught a glimpse of him from afar
and ran to meet him. For a while they walked
together in silence, then the old stag asked:
“Well, do they still talk about him the way they
used to?”</p>

<p>Bambi understood that he referred to Gobo and
replied, “I don’t know. I’m nearly alone now.”
He hesitated, “But I think of him very often.”</p>

<p>“Really,” said the old stag, “are you alone
now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bambi expectantly, but the old
stag remained silent.</p>

<p>They went on. Suddenly the old stag stopped.
“Don’t you hear anything?” he asked.</p>

<p>Bambi listened. He didn’t hear anything.</p>

<p>“Come,” cried the old stag and hurried forward.
Bambi followed him. The stag stopped
again. “Don’t you hear anything yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>Then Bambi heard a rustling that he did not
understand. It sounded like branches being bent
down and repeatedly springing up again. Something
was beating the earth dully and irregularly.</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to flee but the old stag cried,
“Come with me,” and ran in the direction of the
noise. Bambi at his side ventured to ask, “Isn’t
it dangerous?”</p>

<p>“It’s terribly dangerous,” the old stag answered
mysteriously.</p>

<p>Soon they saw branches being pulled and
tugged at from below and shaken violently. They
went nearer and saw that a little trail ran through
the middle of the bushes.</p>

<p>Friend Hare was lying on the ground. He
flung himself from side to side and writhed. Then
he lay still and writhed again. Each of his motions
pulled at the branches over him.</p>

<p>Bambi noticed a dark threadlike leash. It ran
right from the branch to Friend Hare and was
twisted around his neck.</p>

<p>Friend Hare must have heard someone coming,
for he flung himself wildly into the air and fell
to the ground. He tried to escape and rolled,
jerking and writhing in the grass.</p>

<p>“Lie still,” the old stag commanded. Then
sympathetically, with a gentle voice that went to
Bambi’s heart, he repeated in his ear, “Be easy,
Friend Hare, it’s I. Don’t move now. Lie perfectly
still.”</p>

<p>The Hare lay motionless, flat on the ground.
His throttled breath rattled softly in his throat.</p>

<p>The old stag took the branch between his teeth,
and twisted it. He bent down. Then he walked
around putting his weight cunningly against it.
He held it to the earth with his hoof and snapped
it with a single blow of his antlers.</p>

<p>Then he nodded encouragingly to the Hare.
“Lie still,” he said, “even if I hurt you.”</p>

<p>Holding his head on one side, he laid one
prong of his antlers close to the Hare’s neck
and pressed into the fur behind his ear. He
made an effort and nodded. The Hare began to
writhe.</p>

<p>The old stag immediately drew back. “Lie
still,” he commanded, “it’s a question of life and
death for you.” He began over again. The Hare
lay still gasping. Bambi stood close by, speechless
with amazement.</p>

<p>One of the old stag’s antlers, pressing against
the Hare’s fur, had slipped under the noose. The
old stag was almost kneeling and twisted his head
as though he were charging. He drove his antlers
deeper and deeper under the noose, which
gave at last and began to loosen.</p>

<p>The Hare could breathe again and his terror
and pain burst from him instantly. “E-e-eh!” he
cried bitterly.</p>

<p>The old stag stopped. “Keep quiet!” he cried,
reproaching him gently, “keep quiet.” His mouth
was close to the Hare’s shoulder, his antlers lay
with a prong between the spoonlike ears. It
looked as if he had spitted the Hare.</p>

<p>“How can you be so stupid as to cry at this
time?” he grumbled gently. “Do you want the fox
to come? Do you? I thought not. Keep quiet
then.”</p>

<p>He continued to work away, slowly exerting all
his strength. Suddenly the noose broke with a
loud snap. The Hare slipped out and was free,
without realizing it for a moment. He took a
step and sat down again dazed. Then he hopped
away, slowly and timidly at first, then faster and
faster. Presently he was running with wild leaps.</p>

<p>Bambi looked after him. “Without so much as
a thank you,” he exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>“He’s still terrified,” said the old stag.</p>

<p>The noose lay on the ground. Bambi touched
it gently. It creaked, terrifying Bambi. That
was a sound such as he had never heard in the
woods.</p>

<p>“He?” asked Bambi softly.</p>

<p>The old stag nodded.</p>

<p>They walked on together in silence. “Take care
when you’re going along a trail,” said the old
stag, “test all the branches. Prod them on all
sides of you with your antlers. And turn back at
once if you hear that creak. And when you’ve
shed your antlers be doubly cautious. I never use
trails any more.”</p>

<p>Bambi sank into troubled thought.</p>

<p>“He isn’t here,” he whispered to himself in
profound astonishment.</p>

<p>“No, He’s not in the forest now,” the old stag
answered.</p>

<p>“And yet He is here,” said Bambi shaking his
head.</p>

<p>The old stag went on and his voice was full
of bitterness. “How did your Gobo put it...?
Didn’t Gobo tell you He is all-powerful and all-good.”</p>

<p>“He was good to Gobo,” Bambi whispered.</p>

<p>The old stag stopped. “Do you believe that,
Bambi?” he asked sadly. For the first time he
had called Bambi by his name.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” cried Bambi hurt, “I don’t
understand it.”</p>

<p>The old stag said slowly, “We must learn to
live and be cautious.”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>One</span> morning Bambi came to grief.</p>

<p>The pale gray dawn was just creeping through
the forest. A milky-white mist was rising from the
meadow and the stillness that precedes the coming
of light was everywhere. The crows were not
awake yet, nor the magpies. The jays were asleep.</p>

<p>Bambi had met Faline the night before. She
looked sadly at him and was very shy.</p>

<p>“I’m so much alone now,” she said gently.</p>

<p>“I’m alone too,” Bambi answered with some
hesitation.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you stay with me any more?”
Faline asked sorrowfully, and it hurt him to see
the gay and lively Faline so serious and downcast.</p>

<p>“I want to be alone,” he replied. And gently
as he tried to say it, it sounded hard. He felt it
himself.</p>

<p>Faline looked at him and asked softly, “Do
you love me still?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Bambi answered in the same
tone.</p>

<p>She walked silently away from him, leaving
him alone.</p>

<p>He stood under the great oak at the meadow’s
edge and peered out cautiously, drinking in the
pure and odorless morning air. It was moist and
fresh from the earth, the dew, the grass and the
wet woods. Bambi breathed in great gulps of it.
All at once his spirit felt freer than for a long
time. He walked happily onto the mist-covered
meadow.</p>

<p>Then a sound like thunder crashed.</p>

<p>Bambi felt a fearful blow that made him
stagger.</p>

<p>Mad with terror, he sprang back into the
thicket and kept running. He did not understand
what had happened. He could not grasp a single
idea. He could only keep running on and on.
Fear gripped his heart so that his breath failed
as he rushed blindly on. Then a killing pain shot
through him, so that he felt that he could not
bear it. He felt something hot running over his
left shoulder. It was like a thin, burning thread
coming from where the pain shot through him.
Bambi had to stop running. He was forced to
walk slower. Then he saw that he was limping.
He sank down.</p>

<p>It was comfortable just to lie there and rest.</p>

<p>“Up, Bambi! Get up!” the old stag was standing
beside him, and nudging his shoulder gently.</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to answer, “I can’t,” but the old
stag repeated, “Up! Up!” And there was such
compulsion in his voice and such tenderness that
Bambi kept silent. Even the pain that shot
through him stopped for a minute.</p>

<p>Then the old stag said hurriedly and anxiously,
“Get up! You must get away, my son.” My son!
The words seemed to have escaped him. In a
flash Bambi was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Good,” said the old stag, breathing deeply
and speaking emphatically, “come with me now
and keep close beside me.”</p>

<p>He walked swiftly ahead. Bambi followed him
but he felt a burning desire to let himself drop
to the ground, to lie still and rest.</p>

<p>The old stag seemed to guess it and talked to
him without stopping. “Now you’ll have to bear
every pain. You can’t think of lying down now.
You mustn’t think of it even for a moment. That’s
enough to tire you in itself. You must save yourself,
do you understand me, Bambi? Save yourself.
Or else you are lost. Just remember that
He is behind you, do you understand, Bambi?
And He will kill you without mercy. Come on.
Keep close to me. You’ll soon be all right. You
must be all right.”</p>

<p>Bambi had no strength left to think with. The
pain shot through him at every step he took. It
took away his breath and his consciousness. The
hot trickle, burning his shoulder, seared him like
some deep heartfelt trouble.</p>

<p>The old stag made a wide circle. It took a long
time. Through his veil of pain and weakness,
Bambi was amazed to see that they were passing
the great oak again.</p>

<p>The old stag stopped and snuffed the ground.
“He’s still here,” he whispered. “It’s He. And
that’s His dog. Come along. Faster!” They
ran.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old stag stopped again. “Look,”
he said, “that’s where you lay on the ground.”</p>

<p>Bambi saw the crushed grasses where a wide
pool of his own blood was soaking into the earth.</p>

<p>The old stag snuffed warily around the spot.
“They were here, He and His dog,” he said.
“Come along!” He went ahead slowly, snuffing
again and again.</p>

<p>Bambi saw the red drops gleaming on the leaves
of the bushes and the grass stems. “We passed here
before,” he thought. But he couldn’t speak.</p>

<p>“Aha!” said the old stag and seemed almost
joyful, “we’re behind them now.”</p>

<p>He continued for a while on the same path.
Then he doubled unexpectedly and began a new
circle. Bambi staggered after him. They came to
the oak again but on the opposite side. For the
second time they passed the place where Bambi
had fallen down. Then the old stag went in still
another direction.</p>

<p>“Eat that,” he commanded suddenly, stopping
and pushing aside the grasses. He pointed to a
pair of short dark-green leaves growing close together
near the ground.</p>

<p>Bambi obeyed. They tasted terribly bitter and
smelt sickeningly.</p>

<p>“How do you feel now?” the stag asked after
a while.</p>

<p>“Better,” Bambi answered quickly. He was
suddenly able to speak again. His senses had
cleared and his fatigue grew less.</p>

<p>“Let’s move on again,” the old stag commanded
after another pause. After Bambi had
been following him for a long time he said, “At
last!” They stopped.</p>

<p>“The bleeding has stopped,” said the old stag,
“the blood’s stopped flowing from your wound.
It isn’t emptying your veins now. And it can’t
betray you any more either. It can’t show Him
and His dog where to find you and kill you.”</p>

<p>The old stag looked worried and tired but his
voice sounded joyful. “Come along,” he went on,
“now you can rest.”</p>

<p>They reached a wide ditch which Bambi had
never crossed. The old stag climbed down and
Bambi tried to follow him. But it cost him a
great effort to climb the steep slope on the farther
side. The pain began to shoot violently through
him again. He stumbled, regained his feet, and
stumbled again, breathing hard.</p>

<p>“I can’t help you,” said the old stag, “you’ll
have to get up yourself.” Bambi reached the top.
He felt the hot trickle on his shoulder again. He
felt his strength ebbing for the second time.</p>

<p>“You’re bleeding again,” said the old stag, “I
thought you would. But it’s only a little,” he
added in a whisper, “and it doesn’t make any difference
now.”</p>

<p>They walked very slowly through a grove of
lofty beeches. The ground was soft and level.
They walked easily on it. Bambi felt a longing to
lie down there, to stretch out and never move his
limbs again. He couldn’t go any further. His
head ached. There was a humming in his ears.
His nerves were quivering, and fever began to
rack him. There was a darkness before his eyes.
He felt nothing but a desire for rest and a detached
amazement at finding his life so changed
and shattered. He remembered how he had
walked whole and uninjured through the woods
that morning. It was barely an hour ago, and it
seemed to him like some memory out of a distant,
long-vanished past.</p>

<p>They passed through a scrub-oak and dogwood
thicket. A huge, hollow beech trunk, thickly entangled
with the bushes, lay right in front of
them, barring the way.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” Bambi heard the old stag saying.
He walked along the beech trunk and
Bambi walked beside him. He nearly fell into a
hollow that lay in front of him.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said the old stag at the moment,
“you can lie down here.”</p>

<p>Bambi sank down and did not move again.</p>

<p>The hollow was still deeper under the beech
trunk and formed a little chamber. The bushes
closed thickly across the top so that whoever was
within lay hidden.</p>

<p>“You’ll be safe here,” said the old stag.</p>

<p>Days passed.</p>

<p>Bambi lay on the warm earth with the mouldering
bark of the fallen tree above him. He felt
his pain intensify and then grow less and less until
it died away more and more gently.</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Sometimes he would creep out and stand swaying
weakly on his unsteady legs. He would take
a few steps to look for food. He ate plants now
that he had never noticed before. Now they appealed
to his taste and attracted him by their
strange, enticing acrid smell. Everything that he
had disdained before and would spit out if it got
accidentally into his mouth, seemed appetizing
to him. He still disliked many of the little leaves
and short, coarse shoots, but he ate them anyway,
as though he were compelled to, and his wound
healed faster. He felt his strength returning.</p>

<p>He was cured, but he didn’t leave the hollow
yet. He walked around a little at night, but lay
quietly on his bed by day. Not until the fever had
entirely left his body did Bambi begin to think
over all that had happened to him. Then a great
terror awoke in him, and a profound tremor
passed through his heart. He could not shake
himself free of it. He could not get up and run
about as before. He lay still and troubled. He
felt terrified, ashamed, amazed and troubled by
turns. Sometimes he was full of despair, at others
of joy.</p>

<p>The old stag was always with him. At first he
stayed day and night at Bambi’s side. Then he
left him alone at times, especially when he saw
Bambi deep in thought. But he always kept close
at hand.</p>

<p>One night there was thunder and lightning and
a downpour of rain, although the sky was clear
and the setting sun was streaming down. The
blackbirds sang loudly in all the neighboring tree-tops,
the finches warbled, the tit-mice chirped in
the bushes. Among the grasses or from under
the bushes, the metallic, throaty cackling of the
pheasants sounded at intervals. The woodpecker
laughed exultantly and the doves cooed their
fervid love.</p>

<p>Bambi crept out of the hollow. Life was beautiful.
The old stag was standing there as though
he expected Bambi. They sauntered on together.
But Bambi did not return to the hollow or the
old stag again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>One</span> night when the air was whispering
with the autumnal fall of leaves the screech-owl
shrieked piercingly among the branches. Then
he waited.</p>

<p>But Bambi had spied him already through the
thinning leaves, and stopped.</p>

<p>The screech-owl flew nearer and shrieked
louder. Then he waited again. But Bambi did
not say anything.</p>

<p>Then the owl could restrain himself no longer.
“Aren’t you frightened?” he asked, displeased.</p>

<p>“Well,” Bambi replied, “a little.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” the screech-owl cooed in an
offended tone. “Only a little. You used to get
terribly frightened. It was really a pleasure to
see how frightened you’d get. But for some reason
or other you’re only a little frightened now.”
He grew angrier and repeated, “Only a little!”</p>

<p>The screech-owl was getting old, and that was
why he was so much vainer and so much more
sensitive than before.</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to answer, “I wasn’t ever frightened
before either,” but he decided to keep that
to himself. He was sorry to see the good old
screech-owl sitting there so angry. He tried to
soothe him. “Maybe it’s because I thought of
you right away,” he said.</p>

<p>“What?” said the screech-owl becoming happy
again, “you really did think of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bambi answered with some hesitation,
“as soon as I heard you screech. Otherwise, of
course, I’d have been as scared as ever.”</p>

<p>“Really?” cooed the owl.</p>

<p>Bambi hadn’t the heart to deny it. What difference
did it make anyhow? Let the little old
child enjoy himself.</p>

<p>“I really did,” he assured him, and went on,
“I’m so happy, for a thrill goes through me when
I hear you so suddenly.”</p>

<p>The screech-owl fluffed up his feathers into a soft,
brownish-gray, downy ball. He was happy. “It’s
nice of you to think of me,” he cooed tenderly, “very
nice. We haven’t seen each other for a long time.”</p>

<p>“A very long time,” said Bambi.</p>

<p>“You don’t use the old trails any more, do
you?” the screech-owl inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” said Bambi slowly, “I don’t use the old
trails any more.”</p>

<p>“I’m also seeing more of the world than I used
to,” the screech-owl observed boastfully. He
didn’t mention that he had been driven from his
old hereditary haunts by a pitiless younger rival.
“You can’t stay forever in the same spot,” he
added. Then he waited for an answer.</p>

<p>But Bambi had gone away. By now he understood
almost as well as the old stag how to disappear
suddenly and noiselessly.</p>

<p>The screech-owl was provoked. “It’s a shame....” he cooed to himself. He shook his feathers,
sank his bill deep into his breast and silently
philosophized, “You should never imagine you
can be friends with great folks. They can be as
nice as pie but when the time comes they haven’t
a thought for you, and you’re left sitting stupidly
by yourself as I’m sitting here now....”</p>

<p>Suddenly he dropped to the earth like a stone.
He had spied a mouse. It squeaked once in his
talons. He tore it to pieces, for he was furious.
He crammed the little morsel faster than usual.
Then he flew off. “What do all your great folks
mean to me?” he asked. “Not a thing.” He began
to screech so piercingly and ceaselessly that a pair
of wood-doves whom he passed awoke and fled
from their roost with loud wingbeats.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:2em;'>⁂</p>

<p>The storm swept the woods for several days
and tore the last leaves from the branches. Then
the trees stood stripped.</p>

<p>Bambi was wandering homewards in the gray
dawn in order to sleep in the hollow with the old
stag.</p>

<p>A shrill voice called him once or twice in quick
succession. He stopped. Then the squirrel scampered
down from the branches in a twinkling and
sat on the ground in front of him.</p>

<p>“Is it really you?” he shrilled, surprised and
delighted. “I recognized you the minute you
passed me but I couldn’t believe ...”</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” asked Bambi.</p>

<p>The merry little face in front of him grew
quite troubled. “The oak is gone,” he began
plaintively, “my beautiful old oak, do you remember
it? It was awful. He chopped it down!”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus23.jpg" alt="" id="illus23">
  <div class="caption">
    <p>“My beautiful old oak, do you remember it? It was awful. He chopped it down!”</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Bambi hung his head sadly. His very soul felt
sorry for the wonderful old tree.</p>

<p>“As soon as it happened,” the squirrel related,
“everybody who lived in the tree fled and watched
how He bit through the trunk with a gigantic
flashing tooth. The tree groaned aloud when it
was wounded. It kept on groaning and the tooth
kept gnawing, it was dreadful to hear it. Then
the poor beautiful tree fell out on the meadow.
Everybody cried.”</p>

<p>Bambi was silent.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed the squirrel, “He can do anything.
He’s all-powerful.” He gazed at Bambi
out of his big eyes, and pointed his ears. But
Bambi kept silent.</p>

<p>“Then we were all homeless,” the squirrel
went on, “I don’t even know where the others
scattered to. I came here. But I won’t find another
tree like that in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“The old oak,” said Bambi to himself, “I
knew it from the time I was a child.”</p>

<p>“O well,” said the squirrel. “But to think it’s
really you,” he went on delightedly. “Everybody
said you must be dead long ago. Of course there
were some people now and then who said you
were still alive. Once in a while someone said
he had seen you. But nobody could find out anything
definite. And so I thought it was only
gossip,” the squirrel gazed at him inquisitively,
“since you didn’t come back any more.”</p>

<p>Bambi could see how curious he was and how
he was fishing for an answer.</p>

<p>Bambi kept silent. But a gentle anxious curiosity
was stirring in him, too. He wanted to ask
about Faline, about Aunt Ena, and Ronno and
Karus, about all his childhood companions. But
he kept silent.</p>

<p>The squirrel still sat in front of him, studying
him. “What antlers!” he cried admiringly.
“What antlers! Nobody in the whole forest, except
the old Prince, has antlers like that.”</p>

<p>Once Bambi would have felt elated and flattered
by such praise. But he only said, “Maybe.”</p>

<p>The squirrel nodded quickly with his head.
“Really,” he said, surprised, “you’re beginning to
get gray.”</p>

<p>Bambi wandered on.</p>

<p>The squirrel perceived that the conversation
was over and sprang through the bushes. “Good
day,” he shouted down. “Good-by. I’m very glad I
met you. If I see any of your acquaintances I’ll tell
them you’re still alive. They’ll all be glad.”</p>

<p>Bambi heard him and again felt that gentle
stirring in his heart. But he said nothing. When
he was still a child the old stag had taught him
that you must live alone. Then and afterwards
the old stag had revealed much wisdom and many
secrets to him. But of all his teachings this had
been the most important; you must live alone, if
you wanted to preserve yourself, if you understood
existence, if you wanted to attain wisdom,
you had to live alone.</p>

<p>“But,” Bambi had once objected, “we two are
always together now.”</p>

<p>“Not for very much longer,” the old stag had
answered quickly. That was a few weeks ago.
Now it occurred to Bambi again, and he suddenly
remembered how even the old stag’s very first
words to him had been about singleness. That
day when Bambi was still a child calling for his
mother, the old stag had come to him and asked
him, “Can’t you stay by yourself?”</p>

<p>Bambi wandered on.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> forest was again under snow,
lying silent beneath its deep white mantle. Only
the crows’ calls could be heard. Now and then
came a magpie’s noisy chattering. The soft twittering
of the tit-mice sounded timidly. Then the
frost hardened and everything grew still. The
air began to hum with the cold.</p>

<p>One morning a dog’s baying broke the silence.</p>

<p>It was a continuous hurrying bay that pressed
on quickly through the woods, eager and clear
and harrying with loud yelps.</p>

<p>Bambi raised his head in the hollow under the
fallen tree, and looked at the old stag who was
lying beside him.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” said the old stag in answer
to Bambi’s glance, “nothing that need bother us.”</p>

<p>Still they both listened.</p>

<p>They lay in their hollow with the old beech
trunk like a sheltering roof above them. The
deep snow kept the icy draught from them, and
the tangled bushes hid them from curious eyes.</p>

<p>The baying grew nearer. It was angry and
panting and relentless. It sounded like the bark
of a small hound. It came constantly closer.</p>

<p>Then they heard panting of another kind.
They heard a low labored snarling under the
angry barking. Bambi grew uneasy, but the old
stag quieted him again. “We don’t need to worry
about it,” he said. They lay silent in their warm
hollow and peered out.</p>

<p>The footsteps drew nearer and nearer through
the branches. The snow dropped from the shaken
boughs and clouds of it rose from the earth.</p>

<p>Through the snow and over the roots and
branches, the fox came springing, crouching and
slinking. They were right; a little, short-legged
hound was after him.</p>

<hr class="chap">

  <div class="caption">
    <p>The fox came springing, crouching and slinking. A little, short-legged hound was after him.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>One of the fox’s forelegs was crushed and the fur
torn around it. He held his shattered paw in front
of him, and blood poured from his wound. He
was gasping for breath. His eyes were staring with
terror and exertion. He was beside himself with
rage and fear. He was desperate and exhausted.</p>

<p>Once in a while he would face around and snarl
so that the dog was startled and would fall back
a few steps.</p>

<p>Presently the fox sat down on his haunches.
He could go no farther. Raising his mangled
forepaw pitifully, with his jaws open and his
lips drawn back, he snarled at the dog.</p>

<p>But the dog was never silent for a minute. His
high, rasping bark only grew fuller and deeper.
“Here,” he yapped, “here he is! Here! Here!
Here!” He was not abusing the fox. He was not
even speaking to him, but was urging on someone
who was still far behind.</p>

<p>Bambi knew as well as the old stag did that
it was He the dog was calling.</p>

<p>The fox knew it too. The blood was streaming
down from him and fell from his breast into the
snow, making a fiery red spot on the icy white
surface, and steaming slowly.</p>

<p>A weakness overcame the fox. His crushed
foot sank down helpless, but a burning pain shot
through it when it touched the cold snow. He
lifted it again with an effort and held it quivering
in front of him.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” said the fox beginning to speak,
“let me go.” He spoke softly and beseechingly.
He was quite weak and despondent.</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” the dog howled.</p>

<p>The fox pleaded still more insistently. “We’re
relations,” he pleaded, “we’re brothers almost.
Let me go home. Let me die with my family at
least. We’re brothers almost, you and I.”</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” the dog raged.</p>

<p>Then the fox rose so that he was sitting perfectly
erect. He dropped his handsome pointed
muzzle on his bleeding breast, raised his eyes
and looked the dog straight in the face. In a
completely altered voice, restrained and embittered,
he growled, “Aren’t you ashamed, you
traitor!”</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” yelped the dog.</p>

<p>But the fox went on, “You turncoat, you renegade.”
His maimed body was taut with contempt
and hatred. “You spy,” he hissed, “you blackguard,
you track us where He could never find
us. You betray us, your own relations, me who
am almost your brother. And you stand there
and aren’t ashamed!”</p>

<p>Instantly many other voices sounded loudly
round about.</p>

<p>“Traitor!” cried the magpie from the tree.</p>

<p>“Spy!” shrieked the jay.</p>

<p>“Blackguard!” the weasel hissed.</p>

<p>“Renegade!” snarled the ferret.</p>

<p>From every tree and bush came chirpings,
peepings, shrill cries, while overhead the crows
cawed, “Spy! Spy!” Everyone had rushed up, and
from the trees or from safe hiding places on
the ground, they watched the contest. The fury
that had burst from the fox released an embittered
anger in them all. And the blood spilt
on the snow, that steamed before their eyes,
maddened them and made them forget all caution.</p>

<p>The dog stared around him. “Who are you?”
he yelped. “What do you want? What do you
know about it? What are you talking about?
Everything belongs to Him, just as I do. But I,
I love Him. I worship Him, I serve Him. Do
you think you can oppose Him, poor creatures
like you? He’s all-powerful. He’s above all of
you. Everything we have comes from Him.
Everything that lives or grows comes from Him.”
The dog was quivering with exaltation.</p>

<p>“Traitor!” cried the squirrel shrilly.</p>

<p>“Yes, traitor!” hissed the fox. “Nobody is a
traitor but you, only you.”</p>

<p>The dog was dancing about in a frenzy of devotion.
“Only me?” he cried, “you lie. Aren’t
there many, many others on His side? The horse,
the cow, the sheep, the chickens, many, many of
you and your kind are on His side and worship
Him and serve Him.”</p>

<p>“They’re rabble!” snarled the fox, full of a
boundless contempt.</p>

<p>Then the dog could contain himself no longer
and sprang at the fox’s throat. Growling, spitting,
and yelping, they rolled in the snow, a writhing,
savagely snapping mass from which fur flew. The
snow rose in clouds and was spattered with fine
drops of blood. At last the fox could not fight
any more. In a few seconds he was lying on his
back, his white belly uppermost. He twitched
and stiffened and died.</p>

<p>The dog shook him a few times, then let him
fall on the trampled snow. He stood beside him,
his legs planted, calling in a deep, loud voice,
“Here! Here! He’s here!”</p>

<p>The others were horrorstruck and fled in all
directions.</p>

<p>“Dreadful,” said Bambi softly to the old stag
in the hollow.</p>

<p>“The most dreadful part of all,” the old stag
answered, “is that the dogs believe what the
hound just said. They believe it, they pass their
lives in fear, they hate Him and themselves and
yet they’d die for His sake.”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> cold broke, and there was a warm
spell in the middle of the winter. The earth
drank great draughts of the melting snows so that
wide stretches of soil were everywhere visible.
The blackbirds were not singing yet, but when
they flew from the ground where they were hunting
worms, or when they fluttered from tree to
tree, they uttered a long-drawn joyous whistle that
was almost a song. The woodpecker began to
chatter now and then. Magpies and crows grew
more talkative. The tit-mice chirped more cheerily.
And the pheasants, swooping down from
their roosts would stand in one spot preening
their feathers and uttering their metallic throaty
cacklings.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>One such morning Bambi was roaming around
as usual. In the gray dawn he came to the edge
of the hollow. On the farther side where he had
lived before something was stirring. Bambi stayed
hidden in the thicket and peered across. A deer
was wandering slowly to and fro, looking for
places where the snow had melted, and cropping
whatever grasses had sprung up so early.</p>

<p>Bambi wanted to turn at once and go away,
for he recognized Faline. His first impulse was
to spring forward and call her. But he stood as
though rooted to the spot. He had not seen Faline
for a long time. His heart began to beat
faster. Faline moved slowly as though she were
tired and sad. She resembled her mother now.
She looked as old as Aunt Ena, as Bambi noticed
with a strangely pained surprise.</p>

<p>Faline lifted her head and gazed across as
though she sensed his presence. Again Bambi
started forward, but he stopped again, hesitating
and unable to stir.</p>

<p>He saw that Faline had grown old and gray.</p>

<p>“Gay, pert little Faline, how lovely she used
to be,” he thought, “and how lively!” His whole
youth suddenly flashed before his eyes. The
meadow, the trails where he walked with his
mother, the happy games with Gobo and Faline,
the nice grasshoppers and butterflies, the fight
with Karus and Ronno when he had won Faline
for his own. He felt happy again, and yet he
trembled.</p>

<p>Faline wandered on, her head drooped to the
ground, walking slowly, sadly and wearily away.
At that moment Bambi loved her with an overpowering,
tender melancholy. He wanted to rush
through the hollow that separated him from the
others. He wanted to overtake her, to talk with
her, to talk to her about their youth and about
everything that had happened.</p>

<p>He gazed after her as she went off, passing
under the bare branches till finally she was lost
to sight.</p>

<p>He stood there a long time staring after her.</p>

<p>Then there was a crash like thunder. Bambi
shrank together. It came from where he was
standing. Not even from a little way off but right
beside him.</p>

<p>Then there was a second thunderclap, and right
after that another.</p>

<p>Bambi leaped a little farther into the thicket,
then stopped and listened. Everything was still.
He glided stealthily homewards.</p>

<p>The old stag was there before him. He had
not lain down yet, but was standing beside the
fallen beech trunk expectantly.</p>

<p>“Where have you been so long?” he asked so
seriously that Bambi grew silent.</p>

<p>“Did you hear it?” the old stag went on after
a pause.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bambi answered, “three times. He
must be in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” the old stag nodded, and repeated
with a peculiar intonation, “He is in the woods
and we must go.”</p>

<p>“Where?” the word escaped Bambi.</p>

<p>“Where He is now,” said the old stag, and his
voice was solemn.</p>

<p>Bambi was terrified.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened,” the old stag went on,
“come with me and don’t be frightened. I’m glad
that I can take you and show you the way....”
He hesitated and added softly, “Before I go.”</p>

<p>Bambi looked wonderingly at the old stag. And
suddenly he noticed how aged he looked. His
head was completely gray now. His face was
perfectly gaunt. The deep light was extinguished
in his eyes, and they had a feeble, greenish luster
and seemed to be blind.</p>

<p>Bambi and the old stag had not gone far before
they caught the first whiff of that acrid smell that
sent such dread and terror to their hearts.</p>

<p>Bambi stopped. But the old stag went on directly
towards the scent. Bambi followed hesitantly.</p>

<p>The terrifying scent grew stronger and
stronger. But the old stag kept on without stopping.
The idea of flight sprang up in Bambi’s
mind and tugged at his heart. It seethed through
his mind and body, and nearly swept him away.
But he kept a firm grip on himself and stayed
close behind the old stag.</p>

<p>Then the horrible scent grew so strong that it
drowned out everything else, and it was hardly
possible to breathe.</p>

<p>“Here He is,” said the old stag moving to one
side.</p>

<p>Through the bare branches, Bambi saw Him
lying on the trampled snow a few steps away.</p>

<p>An irresistible burst of terror swept over
Bambi and with a sudden bound he started to
give in to his impulse to flee.</p>

<p>“Halt!” he heard the old stag calling. Bambi
looked around and saw the stag standing calmly
where He was lying on the ground. Bambi was
amazed and, moved by a sense of obedience, a
boundless curiosity and quivering expectancy, he
went closer.</p>

<p>“Come near,” said the old stag, “don’t be
afraid.”</p>

<p>He was lying with His pale, naked face turned
upwards, His hat a little to one side on the snow.
Bambi who did not know anything about hats
thought His horrible head was split in two. The
poacher’s shirt, open at the neck, was pierced
where a wound gaped like a small red mouth.
Blood was oozing out slowly. Blood was drying
on His hair and around His nose. A big pool of it
lay on the snow which was melting from the
warmth.</p>

<p>“We can stand right beside Him,” the old stag
began softly, “and it isn’t dangerous.”</p>

<p>Bambi looked down at the prostrate form
whose limbs and skin seemed so mysterious and
terrible to him. He gazed at the dead eyes that
stared up sightlessly at him. Bambi couldn’t understand
it all.</p>

<p>“Bambi,” the old stag went on, “do you remember
what Gobo said and what the dog said,
what they all think, do you remember?”</p>

<p>Bambi could not answer.</p>

<p>“Do you see, Bambi,” the old stag went on,
“do you see how He’s lying there dead, like one
of us? Listen, Bambi. He isn’t all-powerful as
they say. Everything that lives and grows doesn’t
come from Him. He isn’t above us. He’s just
the same as we are. He has the same fears, the
same needs, and suffers in the same way. He can
be killed like us, and then He lies helpless on the
ground like all the rest of us, as you see Him
now.”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“Do you understand me, Bambi?” asked the
old stag.</p>

<p>“I think so,” Bambi said in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Then speak,” the old stag commanded.</p>

<p>Bambi was inspired, and said trembling,
“There is Another who is over us all, over us and
over Him.”</p>

<p>“Now I can go,” said the old stag.</p>

<p>He turned away, and they wandered side by
side for a stretch.</p>

<p>Presently the old stag stopped in front of a
tall oak. “Don’t follow me any further, Bambi,”
he began with a calm voice, “my time is up. Now
I have to look for a resting place.”</p>

<p>Bambi tried to speak.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said the old stag cutting him short,
“don’t. In the hour which I am approaching we
are all alone. Good-by, my son. I loved you
dearly.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Dawn</span> of the summer’s day came
hot, without a breath of wind or the usual morning
chill. The sun seemed to come up faster than
usual. It rose swiftly and flashed like a torch
with dazzling rays.</p>

<p>The dew on the meadows and bushes was
drawn up in an instant. The earth was perfectly
dry so that the clods crumbled. The forest had
been still from an early hour. Only a woodpecker
hammered now and then, or the doves cooed their
tireless, fervid tenderness.</p>

<p>Bambi was standing in a little clearing, forming
a narrow glade in the heart of the thicket.</p>

<p>A swarm of midges danced and hummed
around his head in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>There was a low buzzing among the leaves of
the hazel bushes near Bambi, and a big may-beetle
crawled out and flew slowly by. He flew
among the midges, up and up, till he reached the
tree-top where he intended to sleep till evening.
His wing-covers folded down hard and neatly
and his wings vibrated with strength.</p>

<p>The midges divided to let the may-beetle pass
through, and closed behind him again. His dark
brown body, over which shone the vibrant glassy
shimmer of his whirring wings, flashed for a
moment in the sunshine as he disappeared.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” the midges asked each
other.</p>

<p>“That’s the old may-beetle,” some of them
hummed.</p>

<p>Others said, “All of his offspring are dead.
Only one is still alive. Only one.”</p>

<p>“How long will he live?” a number of midges
asked.</p>

<p>The others answered, “We don’t know. Some
of his offspring live a long time. They live forever
almost.... They see the sun thirty or forty
times, we don’t know exactly how many. Our
lives are long enough, but we see the daylight only
once or twice.”</p>

<p>“How long has the old beetle been living?”
some very small midges asked.</p>

<p>“He has outlived his whole family. He’s as old
as the hills, as old as the hills. He’s seen more
and been through more in this world than we can
even imagine.”</p>

<p>Bambi walked on. “Midge buzzings,” he
thought, “midge buzzings.”</p>

<p>A delicate frightened call came to his ears.</p>

<p>He listened and went closer, perfectly softly,
keeping among the thickest bushes, and moving
noiselessly as he had long known how to do.</p>

<p>The call came again, more urgent, more plaintively.
Fawns’ voices were wailing, “Mother!
Mother!”</p>

<p>Bambi glided through the bushes and followed
the calls.</p>

<p>Two fawns were standing side by side, in their
little red coats, a brother and sister, forsaken and
despondent.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>“Mother! Mother!” they called.</p>

<p>Before they knew what had happened Bambi
was standing in front of them. They stared at
him speechlessly.</p>

<p>“Your mother has no time for you now,” said
Bambi severely.</p>

<p>He looked into the little brother’s eyes.
“Can’t you stay by yourself?” he asked.</p>

<p>The little brother and sister were silent.</p>

<p>Bambi turned and, gliding into the bushes, disappeared
before they had come to their senses.
He walked along.</p>

<p>“The little fellow pleases me,” he thought, “perhaps
I’ll meet him again when he’s larger....”</p>

<p>He walked along. “The little girl is nice too,”
he thought, “Faline looked like that when she
was a fawn.”</p>

<p>He went on, and vanished in the forest.</p>
